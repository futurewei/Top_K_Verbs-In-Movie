SETH’S KITCHEN - MORNINGA pretty sweet kitchen in a pretty nice house in theHollywood hills. As SETH RAPOPORT makes himself breakfast.THREE KITCHEN TV’S blare cable news, all covering the samestory:CNN ANCHORNorth Korean President Kim Il-Hwanresponded to the internationalcommunity’s assertion that he isletting his people starve in thenation’s worst famine in 100 years.KIM IL-HWAN(subtitles)This so-called famine is a fictioninvented by the United States andits lapdog, South Korea. They arejust angry because we havesucceeded in developing our ownnuclear arsenal.(pulls a HEAD OF LETTUCEout of a bag)This lettuce was grown right herein North Korea. I have tasted itand it is delicious. How can we behungry if there are vegetables?SETHTouché.Seth’s PHONE RINGS. He picks up:SETH (CONT’D)Yo.MALE VOICE (V.O.)We’re ready to talk.SETHDo I have the exclusive on this?INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - DAYThe bustle of a STAFF scrambling to put a nightly newsprogram together. Seth directs traffic:SETHWhat do you mean we’re waiting onVT? We’re an hour from air.THE INTERVIEW 2.3/15/12STAFFERI’ll run that down right now.SETH(to another staffer)Check and see if Dave’s landed.STAFFER #2On it!MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)Something strange is happening tome.That’s DAVE SKYLARK who just entered. 30’s, dashinglyhandsome, magnetic charm.SETHDave--DAVESo last night I’m having sex withthis insanely hot girl. And beinginside her feels just ridiculouslygood.(then)But it gets odd. I think I’mbecoming, I don’t know, morereflective or something? Becausein the middle of everything, Isuddenly start thinking about mychildhood.SETHDave, can we first--DAVEEven as a little kid, I was just sohorny. When I was ten, I swore tomyself that when I did finally getlaid, I would never take it forgranted, I would always appreciateit. So there I am last night,inside this woman, about tocompletely explode, and the thoughtin my mind is, I wish 10 year oldme could see me now. It wasjust... it was such a hell of aplace to be mentally.A beat.THE INTERVIEW 3.3/15/12SETHSo the point of the story is thatyou enjoy sex.DAVENo, it’s more nuanced than that,it’s...(then)Well... yeah. I guess that is thepoint.SETHAwesome, I’ll chew on that later.Remember that angle I was working?DAVEYes??SETHThe source is ready to come forwardwith the story.DAVEYou mean...SETHYes. Teri Hatcher’s coming out ofthe closet. To you. On live TV.DAVESONOFABITCH!Dave leaps on to Seth and BEAR HUGS him. We now see thePOSTER for their show in the background: Dave’s smiling mugabove the title: “SKYLARK TONIGHT!”DAVE (CONT’D)You big beautiful bastard! Yourtalent freaks me the fuck out.SETHYeah. My Pulitzer prize is justaround the corner.DAVEWho cares about a Pulitzer whenyou’ve got a Maserati and pussy upthe yin ying? You can’t get ablowjob from a Pulitzer while asecond Pulitzer masturbates as itwatches you.THE INTERVIEW 4.3/15/12SETHThanks, Dave. That’s inspiring.Get your ass in the chair. When Isee you without makeup it ruins themystery.INT. MAKEUP ROOM - LATERDave’s in the chair. He’s looking at the makeup woman,ANNETTE, in the mirror, studying her curiously. Finally:DAVEAnnette. You’ve been weird withme. For, like, the last two weeks.ANNETTE(bad at lying)I... don’t know what you mean.DAVEIf you’re getting ready to quit, Iswear I will gouge my eyeballs outwith a potato peeler.(shouts to the hall)Janine! I need you to get me apotato peeler, some darksunglasses, some magazines inbraille--ANNETTE(laughs)Stop! I’m not quitting!DAVEThen talk to me! What’s happeningwith us?ANNETTEIt’s just... Your grey hairs aregetting hard to conceal.DAVEOh.ANNETTEI used to be able to hide the oneson the side, but they’re on topnow. I didn’t want to bum you out.DAVE(sighs)This is such bullshit. I can’t begreying.THE INTERVIEW 5.3/15/12(MORE)I’m not even close to middle aged.I’m three months into the finalquadrant of my mid 30’s.ANNETTEHow do you want me to handle it? Icould pluck them, I could dye yourhair, or you could just let itshow. Grey is dignified. Betterthan balding.DAVEMaybe just pull them for tonight.ANNETTEOkay. And what about when theycome back? And multiply?For a second Dave looks rattled, but covers with a smile.INT. SKYLARK TONIGHT CONTROL ROOM - NIGHTSeth’s checked out, reading The Economist as Dave interviewsTERI HATCHER. She’s a completely emotionless dud.TERI HATCHERThe transition has been such apositive experience. Everyone’sbeen so supportive.ASSOCIATE PRODUCERSeth, she’s killing us.Seth now looks up from his magazine and checks in.TERI HATCHERI believe you can get throughanything in life if you have goodfriends.ASSOCIATE PRODUCERIt’s like an episode of “Barney.”SETHDave’ll find his way in.DAVETeri... I want you to describe themoment when the wall of selfdelusioncame crashing down, whenyou could no longer bear thetorture of denying your most primaldesires.THE INTERVIEW 6.3/15/12DAVE (CONT'D)SETHHere we go.TERI HATCHERI... I remember the exact moment...I was taking a walk with Carol - myclosest friend in the world.DAVE(delicately, tenderly)Yes. Of course.TERI HATCHERAnd... she asked me if I’d considerdating women, and I said, “Thatactually sounds nice.”(then)And that was basically it.ASSOCIATE PRODUCER Oh come on! DIRECTOR What the fuck! ASSOCIATE PRODUCERHot, celebrity lesbians are boring.That’s the message we’re sending.DIRECTORI say we wrap her up, then go threeacts with the Lohan biographer.SETHNo. He needs more time.(re: something in themonitor)Take camera two.On the MONITOR, a SINGLE OF DAVE. Dave’s face suddenly looksGRAVE, EMOTIONAL.ASSOCIATE PRODUCERWhat’s he doing? Why isn’t hesaying anything?Seth points to the CAMERA 3 MONITOR: Terri’s face is BECOMINGMORE EMOTIONAL in response to Dave’s emotion.ASSOCIATE PRODUCER (CONT’D)Holy shit. Look at that...DAVETeri, I know how deeply you caredfor your mother...THE INTERVIEW 7.3/15/12TERI HATCHERYes...DAVEDo you wish you could have sharedthis part of your life with herbefore she died so tragically frompneumonia?CLOSE ON Teri as she processes. Then: A VOLCANO OF SOBBING.The control rooms gusy all CHEER and APPLAUD.DIRECTORThe man never, ever fails!SETHIt’s a weirdly specific talent.TERI HATCHER(blubbering)I look for my mother in every womanI’m with.ASSOCIATE PRODUCERGuaranteed that quote makes thecover of next week’s People!(high-fiving them)We did it again!SETH(to himself, darkly)Yep... We did it again.The screen suddenly GOES BLACK.DIRECTOR Whoa! SETH No! What the fuck! The monitor switches to the NBC NEWSROOM.BRIAN WILLIAMSGood evening, I’m Brian Williamswith an NBC News special report.Word tonight from our East Asiabureau of alarming militaryescalation on the Korean peninsula.Thousandfold troop increases northof the DMZ have been matched bySouth Korean reinforcements...FOOTAGE of TANKS and GIANT MISSILES on launchers and columnsof goose-stepping soldiers, all marching toward the D.M.Z.THE INTERVIEW 8.3/15/12BRIAN WILLIAMS (CONT’D)Kim Il-Hwan, leader of the bankruptand famine-plagued North Korea, nowdeclares that the government ofSouth Korea owes his nation 12billion in reparations fees foratrocities committed during theKorean War. He warns that ifpayments are not promptly remitted,he will enforce the demandmilitarily, and if necessary, withnuclear weapons.Seth signals to Dave that they’re no longer live. Davegently excuses himself from the sobbing Teri Hatcher.INT. DAVE’S OFFICE - LATERDave looks extremely bummed.DAVEIt just depresses me.SETHOf course. There’s millions ofpeople starving, and this lunaticis spoiling for a nuclear war.DAVEHuh?SETHYou’re depressed about North Korea,right?DAVENo, about the preemption.Seth has no words.DAVE (CONT’D)It makes me feel disposable. Likewhat we do isn’t important.A beat.SETHIt isn’t.DAVEWell, that troubles me.THE INTERVIEW 9.3/15/12SETHSince when?DAVELook, I’m getting older, man.Annette’s plucking greys off myhead. At some point, my looks willbe gone. If I’m just some guy withno looks, doing unimportant shit,then... I mean...SETHI hear you. I do. But what Ithink you’re failing to realize, isjust what an enormous cock yousound like.DAVEReally? Shit. I didn’t mean to.SETHOf course not. You’re a lovelyperson. But there’s an impendingnuclear holocaust. In times likethis you’ve gotta be extra carefulnot to come across as, you know--DAVESelf-absorbed?SETHA rip-roaring, shit-filled asshole.DAVEYou’re so right. Thank god foryou, man.SETHYou know it’s cause I love you.DAVEI know. Now let’s go get you laid.INT. NIGHTCLUB - LATERDave and Seth are lit up and having a damned good time. Eachis doted upon by YOUNG PARTY GIRLS.PARTY GIRLSo what’s it like being a producerfor the great Dave Skylark?THE INTERVIEW 10.3/15/12SETHWell, it’s good money. The work iseasy. Dave’s a great friend.PARTY GIRLThat’s so crazy awesome.SETH(out of obligation)So, what’s it like, uh... assistingsomeone who does PR for a startuponline nail polish company? Imean, that must be a very...PARTY GIRLI wanna show you something.SETHOkay.She WHIPS OFF HER TOP, unleashing ENORMOUS BREASTS which hanglike shelves. She then dumps a PILE OF COCAINE on them them.PARTY GIRL(re: her giant snowcoveredmamaries)Look! It’s Mount Everbreast!Seth stares at the cocaine-covered breasts, concentrating.As if he can’t figure out why this sight doesn’t excite him.DAVE(shouts to Seth and girl)How cute are you guys? We shouldall get a place in Malibu for thesummer!Seth’s confused. He suddenly can’t tell if his life isfun... or incredibly stupid and pointless.INT. SKYLARK TONIGHT CONTROL ROOM - NIGHTThe show is in progress.DAVESo the truth is, Snookie, thatyou’re in love with The Situation?SNOOKIE(sobbing)Yes. I love The Situation.Seth gets up, as if unable to take it anymore.THE INTERVIEW 11.3/15/12SETHLooks like this one’s a cakewalk.I’m gonna duck out early.The screen goes BLACK.DIRECTORFUCK.NBC News:BRIAN WILLIAMSGood evening. A residential islandbelow the 38th parallel has beenshelled by North Korean forces.Approximately one hundred civiliandeaths, some of them children.Seth signals to Dave - they’re no longer live.DAVEMother-FUCKER!!INT. DAVE’S OFFICE - LATERDave paces with great agitation.DAVESomething’s changing in the world.I can tell.SETHBased on what? You don’t read.DAVEWhen we were growing up, there wasnever this threat of nuclear war.SETHThat’s actually amazingly false.DAVEIt didn’t feel the same, okay?Current events didn’t affectAmericans as much. But now thewhole planet is so fucked up,Americans want to know aboutpolitics because they could wind upgetting bombed or swallowed up by aglobal warming storm. Think aboutit, there’s The Daily Show, andRachel Maddow...THE INTERVIEW 12.3/15/12SETHI don’t think we’re endangered.There’s still room for the trivial.DAVEI wanna believe that, Seth, Ireally do. But we’ve beenpreempted four times this month!(then)Look, I’m getting contemplative asshit these days - remember how Igot all nostalgic in the middle ofbanging that chick?(off Seth’s nod)I’m having revelations about allkinds of stuff, and one of the bigones is that the world is growingup.SETHYour hair, Dave. Just your hair isgrowing up.DAVENo. People are getting moreserious, and if we don’t get moreserious with them, I’m gonna be anold, ugly, irrelevant joke. LikeLarry King.SETHAnd how exactly should we get“serious”?DAVEYou know what? We should get thatPresident Kim on the show. He’sthe man of the hour.SETHI’ll get right on that.DAVEI mean it. We should try. You’vegot the fancy journalism degreefrom Columbia. You know politics.SETHTrue. On the other hand, he’s themost reclusive man on the planet.So that could be an obstacle.THE INTERVIEW 13.3/15/12DAVECome on. I wanna try this - thesubstance thing. If that’s wherethe world’s going, we can’t getleft behind.SETHThe “substance thing”?DAVEJust give it one hour, okay? Onehour, see how far you get.Seth searches Dave’s face, and sees that Dave isn’t kidding.INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTOn his way out, Seth spots Annette and stops her.SETH(sternly)Not another word about his greyhairs. From now on, just be quietand let the fucking things grow.Annette nods obediently and moves on.INT. SETH’S OFFICE - DAYDave pops his head in.DAVEDid you reach him? Did he say yes?SETHAll I’ve learned is that there’s aBritish Embassy in Pyongyang. Andthat Kim once kidnapped AlfredHitchcock’s assistant and forcedhim to direct a western he wrote.DAVESo he’s a fan of our culture -that’s encouraging!SETHDave. He doesn’t need our helpwith public relations. The man has24 million people convinced that heinvented rice.THE INTERVIEW 14.3/15/12DAVEYou’re making this too complicated.Just call him and ask.Seth just shakes his head in dismay at Dave’s stupidity.SETHI’ll call the British Embassy andsee if they’ll get a message tohim.DAVESweet. But find out what time itis over there first. I don’t wannastart off by interrupting himduring dinner.As Dave exits, an extremely annoyed Seth hits a few keys onthe computer, then hits a few keys on the phone. RINGING...BRITISH WOMAN (V.O.)Her Majesty’s Embassy.SETHYes, I wonder if you could help me.I work for an American televisionpersonality. I’m looking to reachthe president’s director ofcommunications.BRITISH WOMAN (V.O.)May I ask for whom you work?SETHDave Skylark.A beat.BRITISH WOMAN (V.O.)I beg your pardon, sir, but is thisa joke?SETHWell, not from Mr. Skylark’sperspective.INT. SETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT2 AM-ish. Seth’s frying eggs after a night of partying. Wehear a WOMAN PUKING HER GUTS UP in the background.THE INTERVIEW 15.3/15/12DRUNK WOMAN (O.S.)(calls from bathroom)Soon as I’m done, I’m gonna fuckthe SHIT out of you!SETH(calling back)I think we should take it slow. Ihave a history of getting attachedtoo quickly.Seth’s cell phone rings. The number on the screen reads: “0-0-0-0-0.” Odd time of night for an unrecognized call.SETH (CONT’D)Hello?ELECTRONIC BEEPS AND STATIC indicate a very internationalcall. A THICKLY ASIAN-ACCENTED VOICE speaks tersely:ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)I am trying to reach Seth Rapoport.SETHSpeaking.ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)We are in receipt of your request,and wish to meet with you.SETHWait... who is this?ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)You left word with our governmentregarding an interview.SETHGee, let me guess: is your nameLouis Stools? Or maybe Curtis E.Flush?ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)... I do not under--SETHDude, I’m making eggs here. Ifyou’re too wired to get to sleep,take a Xanax and yank it.ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)I am an aide in the office of theSecretariat of the Workers PartyCentral Committee.THE INTERVIEW 16.3/15/12Seth’s eyes POP - Dave doesn’t know that kind of lingo. Thecall is legit.SETHOh... I’m sorry, I thought...ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)Security concerns dictate that thematter be discussed in person.Thursday, August one, at 1600hours, coordinated universal time.Can we expect you?SETHUh, yeah, of course. Where am Igoing? You guys have an LA office?ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)Latitude: 51.635005.30, Longitude:4434879.87.SETHAh, ok. And remind me where thatis, again?ASIAN VOICE (V.O.)50 kilometers west of Dandong.Northeastern China.INT. SETH’S LIVING ROOM - LATERIt’s dawn. Dave and Seth are talking over coffee.SETH... And they want the meeting keptsecret, so they’re not helping meget a visa. I’d have to sneak ontothe mainland through Hong Kong. Ihave no idea what I’m walking into.I could be eaten.DAVECome on. No one could know fromlooking at you just how deliciousyou are.SETHYou’re getting cute with me at 4AM?THE INTERVIEW 17.3/15/12DAVEI don’t know what to say. I’d gowith you, but we’ve got the showevery night this week.SETHHow inconvenient.DAVEI get it, Seth. At first glancethe risk and effort would seem tobe all yours, and the glory allmine. But look into the future.SETHEasy enough. Mine only goes toThursday.DAVEOkay. So we can say fuck it, andjust do 10 more years of what we’vedone for the last 10 years. I canjust dye my hair and thicken themakeup.(then)But I know somewhere in your heart,you’ve got bigger ambitions.Seth doesn’t argue with this point.DAVE (CONT’D)(points to a COLLAGE onthe wall)Look at that pedigree, and tell mesome part of you doesn’t yearn formore.Seth stares up at the FRAMED COLLAGE from his distant past:-Clippings from Seth’s high school paper, with Seth’s byline.-Photo of Seth accepting the Mark of Excellence Award forstudent journalism.-Photo of Seth accepting the Columbia Gold Crown for studentjournalism.-Photo of Seth interviewing John McCain.-Photo of Seth interviewing Barack Obama.SETH(to himself, mournfully)I definitely aimed high, once.THE INTERVIEW 18.3/15/12DAVEI believe you still do.DRUNK WOMAN (V.O.)(puking)Blaarrrrrch!INT. JUMBO JET - NIGHTSeth’s en route to Hong Kong. He studies maps.INT. BOAT - DAYSeth’s en route from Hong Kong to mainland China.INT. SMALL PLANE - DAYSeth’s on a tiny commuter flight from some small city inChina to Beijing. He’s looking pretty tired.INT. CHINESE BUS - DAYA filthy bus from Beijing to the countryside. Sitting nextto Seth is a GUY WITH TWO FINGERS, eating SNAKE MEAT out ofan oily cellophane bag. Seth looks bummed.EXT. FARM VILLAGE - DAYSeth wanders through a dusty hamlet that hasn’t left the 19thCentury. He looks like an alien from outer space among thesepeople. He has several frustrating conversations withPEASANTS who don’t understand English. He points to a placeon the map, but to no avail.Finally a SHRIVELED MAN with an OXCART signals to Seth to hopin back. Seth’s seat mates are some CHICKENS.EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAYThe oxcart struggles up a terrifying MOUNTAIN PATH.One of the chickens lays DEAD next to Seth. SMALL LIZARDSeat the guts out of the chicken. Seth taps the driver on theshoulder to alert him to the situation. The driver shrugs,seeing no problem.THE INTERVIEW 19.3/15/12EXT. MOUNTAINS - MORNINGSeth wakes up looking horrible. He runs his fingers throughhis hair and pulls out CLUMPS OF LICE. At last, he breaksdown and WEEPS. The driver nudges his SON to check out theYankee crying like a little pussy. They both giggle.INT. DAVE’S BEDROOM - DAYDave’s in bed with two beautiful women, KAYTEE and LOLA, postcoitus. They’re all PLAYING BATTLEFIELD 3 ON XBOX.EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAYThe oxcart continues. Seth is drenched in sweat, PUKING overthe side of the cart.EXT. DESERT - DAYThe oxcart stops in the middle of a BARREN HIGH DESERT. Sethchecks the coordinates on his handheld GPS. He’s where he’ssupposed to be. He checks his watch. It’s almost 1600 UTC.Seth pays the driver, and the oxcart takes off.Seth is now alone in the wilderness near the North Koreanborder. There is nothing as far as the eye can see. It’squiet as shit. Seth LIES DOWN IN THE DIRT and waits...EXT. DESERT - LATERSeth wakes to the sound of a HELICOPTER. His face is peltedby dirt from the ROTOR WASH.THREE NORTH KOREAN MEN jump out before the chopper hits theground. They train their AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on Seth.SETH(believes he’s a dead man)Fucking Dave. Stupid, stupidasshole.The chopper skids touch ground. A HOT KOREAN WOMAN, LATE20’S, holding a briefcase, steps out and approaches Seth.This is SOOK YONG-RIM, Assistant to Kim Il-Hwan and Directorof Communications for The Office of The President.One guard SEARCHES Seth for weapons and microphones.THE INTERVIEW 20.3/15/12From her briefcase, Sook takes out a DOSSIER on Seth, andcompares the PHOTOS of him to the man himself. Satisfied,she signals to the guards to stand down.SOOKThe Beloved Leader will grant aninterview to Mr. Skylark. It willbe conducted at an undisclosedlocation. It will have a durationof one hour. All questions will besupplied by us. Mr. Skylark maynot ask follow-up questions. Theinterview will be broadcast live toeliminate editorial corruption ofthe Leader’s message. There willbe no interruptions foradvertisements in promotion of thecapitalist agenda.A beat.SETHIs that all, or do I have--SOOKIf you deviate from the parameters,the interview will be terminated.These parameters are secret. Ifthey are revealed, the interviewwill be cancelled. Do youunderstand and accept the terms?SETHI... it’s not exactly what I...SOOKThe terms are not negotiable.SETHYeah, I sensed that...(then, helpless)I... Okay. Yeah. I accept.SOOKThe meeting will take place onemonth from today. We will send thecoordinates for a pickup site.Sook turns to leave, but Seth calls after her:SETHWait - that’s it?THE INTERVIEW 21.3/15/12SOOKYes.SETHYou couldn’t have just told me thison the phone?SOOKThis engagement poses considerablerisk. The Beloved Leader says thatsufficient trust cannot beestablished in a telephone call.SETHWhy is he agreeing to do this?SOOKHe has an important message for thewest. He is familiar with DaveSkylark’s work, and believes Mr.Skylark is the only journalist whomight treat him fairly.As Sook walks away, Seth, sees through the heat shimmers whathe could swear is a CRAZY HOT BODY on this no-nonsense woman.She boards the chopper and it is gone as quickly as it came.Seth is once again, alone in the desert. He looks at hiswatch. He has long wait. With nothing else to do, he sitsdown in the sand, pulls out this week’s Economist, and reads.INT. SKYLARK TONIGHT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYDave and various staff members eat lunch at a long table.The mood is sombre.STAFFERSix days without word from Seth.STAFFER #2State Department says the searchprocess is more complicated sincehe didn’t have a visa.DAVEI did this to him. This is all me.(then)Who’s the guest tonight? Pleaselet it be someone who can make mefeel good about life for an hour.STAFFERIt’s Kristen Stewart.THE INTERVIEW 22.3/15/12As Dave hangs his head in despair, SETH WALKS IN! Filthy,charred. Clothing torn. The staff all stare, speechless.DAVESeth... Holy shit... I... You...Why haven’t you called?SETHI didn’t encounter as manyopportunities to charge my cellphone as I would have liked.Dave nods - he’s trying to be sensitive. Seth looks grumpy.But finally:DAVEWell I gotta ask - did we get it?SETHYeah. But with some serious limi--Dave - and everyone - freaks out.DAVEFUCK YES! I LOVE YOU, YOU FILTHY,SWEATY, JEW-FRO’D BASTARD!Dave jumps up on the table, TEARS OFF HIS SHIRT, and shoutsin ecstasy. His enthusiasm is hard to resist, and Seth, evenin his wrecked state, cannot contain a smile.SETHOnce again, your baseless optimism,and complete ignorance of how theworld works has led to landmarkachievements.DAVE(high fiving)Damn straight motherfucker!INT. HALLS - LATERSeth walks with Dave as he leaves the set.SETHSo basically, he’d just beinterviewing himself with yourmouth.DAVEShit...THE INTERVIEW 23.3/15/12Dave thinks about this intensely for a few moments, then:DAVE (CONT’D)We gotta do it.Seth looks at Dave - is he serious?DAVE (CONT'D)Dude. It’s Kim Il-Hwan. When youscore a Bin Laden or a Hitler or aKim, you take it. Who cares whatthey actually say? Everyone knowsthey’re dicks, they just wanna seethem on TV. I mean, does our ownpresident ever say anything honestor real to the press? Aren’t allTV interviews just propaganda andsoundbytes?SETHThat’s a depressingly good point.DAVEThanks, man.(then)So Kim really likes me?SETHYep. He likes Stalin, cognac,starvation as a political tool, andyou.DAVEAwesome. We gotta celebrate this.PRESS REACTION MONTAGE:NBC:BRIAN WILLIAMSIn a stunning break with character,the reclusive Kim Il-Hwan hasagreed to give his first interviewsince becoming the North Koreanleader some 30 years ago. The manfor the job: Dave Skylark.CNN:ANDERSON COOPERAnd we must tip our hat tonight toDave Skylark, for this astoundingjournalistic coup.THE INTERVIEW 24.3/15/12SPLIT SCREEN WITH PIERS MORGANANDERSON COOPER (CONT’D)(playfully)Piers, why couldn’t that have beenyou?PIERS MORGAN(a smile masking contempt)Yes, Anderson. I agree it’s quitean achievement.ANDERSON COOPERTonight you have Kirk Cameron onyour show again, is that correct?PIERS MORGAN(smiling through rage)Thank you, Anderson.INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHTAn epic celebration party The place is ROCKING.-Thumping music, THRONGS of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. SERVERS dolingout ample glasses of Veuve.-Dave and Seth DOUBLE-FISTING it with their own bottles ofVeuve, singing along to Queen’s “I Want To Break Free.”-KE$HA DANCES ON A TABLE TOP, and leads the crowd in somesynchronized dance floor moves. JEFF GOLDBLUM climbs on thetable and dances all sexy with her. Dave taps Seth andpoints to the Ke$ha-Jeff Goldblum insanity. Seth laughs hisinebriated head off...INT. LIVING ROOM, DAVE’S HOUSE - MORNINGThe place is a disaster, but a testament to an amazing night.Seth and Dave are both passed out on separate couches.The DOORBELL RINGS. Seth and Dave both begin to wake.DAVEDude?The doorbell RINGS AGAIN.DAVE (CONT’D)(winces from headache)Oh, man. Can you get that?THE INTERVIEW 25.3/15/12Seth staggers to the door. It’s A HOT WOMAN, with red hairand cleavage, and a GUY. Both wear suits and seriousexpressions. The woman’s skirt stops well above the knees.She wears THICK BLACK RIMMED GLASSES - intellectual sexy.WOMANMr. Rapoport, I’m agent Lacey withCentral Intelligence, and this ismy partner, Agent Gregory.MANGood morning, Mr. Rapoport.DAVE(calling from couch)Dude, whoever it is, can you tellthem to fuck off?SETHDave--DAVEThe sunlight’s killing me! I tookso much ecstasy last night. Youknow how it dilates your pupils? Ithink my retinas are blown out!SETH(re: Dave)He’s joking. He loves jokes. Youever have a friend like that?INT. DINING ROOM - LATERSeth and Dave sit across the dining room table from theagents. There’s tons of WEED, COKE, PILLS, PANTIES, etc. onthe table, but the agents ignore it.AGENT LACEYPresident Kim has pushed the worldcloser to nuclear conflict thanit’s been since 1962. He’sisolated, and we believe, mentallyunstable.Dave notices Agent Lacey’s CONSPICUOUS CLEAVAGE.AGENT LACEY (CONT’D)Our integrated intelligencesuggests there might be a schism inKim’s inner circle.THE INTERVIEW 26.3/15/12SETHLike a possible coup?AGENT GREGORYNo, his grasp on power is firm. Wedon’t believe anyone would attemptan overthrow from within.Dave “accidentally” knocks a glass off the table. He ducksunder the table to retrieve it and gets a look at AGENTLACEY’S THIGHS. They’re astonishing.DAVE(to himself)Jesus H. Christ.Dave rejoins the group.AGENT LACEYBut we believe if Kim wereeliminated, it would stabilize theregion that most threatens globalsecurity.SETHWouldn’t that depend on whosucceeds him?AGENT LACEYActually, no. Our estimate is thatanyone at all is better than Kim.SETHAnd you’re telling us this why?AGENT LACEYYou’re going to be in a room withhim. No one in the west has hadthat kind of access to Kim in 30years.(then)We want you to take him out.Seth and Dave exchange a look of shock.SETHKill him?(off their nods)You want us to assassinate theleader of a foreign country?AGENT LACEYThe most dangerous man on earth.THE INTERVIEW 27.3/15/12SETHI don’t get it. Why don’t you guysdo it? You’ve got drones, you’vegot Seal Team Six.AGENT GREGORYAir strikes are too risky. Unlesswe extirpate Kim before he figuresout what’s happening, his firstresponse will be to nuke SouthKorea. With 20,000 of our troopsin the kill zone.AGENT LACEYIf we bomb or raid, we’llinevitably kill dozens of other topleaders who might otherwise bepoised to work with the west. Weneed a precision hit.DAVEI think it sounds great. I’m down.Seth looks to Dave - is he out of his mind?SETH(to the agents)Would you excuse us? This is a lotto digest.INT. BEDROOM, DAVE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATERSeth and Dave confer privately.DAVEThey seem super awesome.SETHYes, Dave, she’s attractive.That’s not an accident. She’s ahoneypot.DAVEA what?SETHA honeypot. A hot chick in a spyagency whose job it is to lure meninto doing things that aren’t goodfor them.THE INTERVIEW 28.3/15/12DAVEThat’s completely misogynistic.You’re saying a woman was onlyhired only because of her goodlooks? Wake up, Seth, it’s 2013.SETHSo she just happens to haveeverything that turns you on - bigbreasts, red hair and glasses.They’re fake, man.DAVEHer breasts?SETHHer glasses.DAVEYou’re sick.SETHListen, I’m gonna take a dump.While I do that, you rub one out.After that, if you’re still up forthis, we’ll discuss it.DAVEAre you serious? I’m not gonnajerk off because you tell me to.SETHWhy not?DAVEIt’s just something I like to do onmy own terms.SETHYou’re obviously just scared thatif you do it, you’ll see that I’mright.DAVEOh, that is so-- uch. Fine.(taking off his pants)You’ll see.As Dave gets into bed pantsless, Seth exits.THE INTERVIEW 29.3/15/12INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATERSeth exits the bathroom. We TRACK with him as he walks downthe hall and into the bedroom. He finds Dave SMOKING ACIGARETTE, post masturbation, chilling out.SETHStill wanna do it?DAVENah. I’m good.BEGIN PUBLIC REACTION MONTAGE:THE DAILY SHOW - NIGHT 1JON STEWARTAt the center of tonight’s storyare two figures. The first, a mannamed Dave Skylark, who began asjust a simple packaging material...OTS IMAGE: A BAG OF STYROFOAM PEANUTS AS DAVE’S HEAD, WITHHIS HAIR AND SMILE PHOTOSHOPPED IN.JON STEWART (CONT’D)... and by force of unrivaledblandness became host of the wildlypopular “Skylark Tonight.” Thesecond figure is the mostmysterious and feared man on theplanet, Kim Il-Hwan.OTS IMAGE of KIM.JON STEWART (CONT'D)Now when it comes to beinginterviewed, Kim has his choice ofjournalists. He could go BrianWilliams or Diane Sawyer, he couldgo old school and give it toKoppel. But he goes with Skylark.Evidently because Mario Lopezwasn’t available?REVEAL that Dave and Seth are watching this in Dave’s office.DAVEWhy is he shitting all over me?THE INTERVIEW 30.3/15/12SETHWell... the election’s over. He’sprobably just desperate for freshtargets.THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW - ANOTHER NIGHTRACHEL MADDOW... And for those who might be lessfamiliar with Dave Skylark’s style,here’s what it looks like when heinterviews bad people:CUE FOOTAGE: Dave with MICHAEL VICK.DAVEDo you ever wish people would stopsaying “That’s the guy who torturedand killed dogs”, and instead say,“That’s the guy who loves Frenchcuisine and mystery novels”?Reveal Seth and Dave watching in Dave’s office.SETH(winces)Oof. Yeah. That was really bad.RACHEL MADDOWMaybe Dave Skylark will reveal anintellectual depth he’s been hidingall these years. But for now, theinterview promises to be a match-upwith the world’s most evil man, andthe world’s shallowest.Dave and Seth are BUMMED.THE CLUB SCENE - ANOTHER NIGHTDave approaches a HOT WOMAN and makes an opening gambit. Sheregards him with disgust, turns and walks away, and isquickly snapped up by MARIO LOPEZ. Dave’s in shock.SETH’S DRY CLEANER - ANOTHER DAYBefore the KOREAN SHOP OWNER hands Seth his shirts, he stopsand addresses Seth, sternly:THE INTERVIEW 31.3/15/12SHOP OWNERWhen I was five years old, Kim Il-Hwan’s secret police arrested myparents because they had let dustgather on the portrait of Kim thathung in our living room.(choking up)I never saw them again.(starts to SOB)Will you ask him where my motheris? Will you ask him why I grew upwithout parents??At this point, Seth looks DEAD INSIDE.FOX NEWS - ANOTHER DAYANN COULTERIt’s a shameless ploy for ratings.Skylark and Rapoport are morallybankrupt.SEAN PENNAnn, for the first time in my life,I can honestly say I agree withyou.Reveal we’re in DAVE’S LIVING ROOM. Seth clicks off the TV.They’re both SUICIDAL.DAVEHow long has this been going on?SETHThirteen days.(sighs)I think the best we can hope for isan earthquake or an oil spill toknock us out of the news cycle.DAVE(shoves papers in Seth’sface)Eleven percent drop in our ratingssince this shit started. Americaofficially hates us!SETHYou gotta hand it to America. Wetried to feed them a load of crap,and they called bullshit on us.Dave turns to Seth.THE INTERVIEW 32.3/15/12DAVEWhat if we did it?SETHDid it? Did what?DAVEKilled him.SETHOh. I definitely think they wouldkill us right back.DAVEBut take that out of the equation.Say we could do it and live.Seth considers for a few moments.SETHOkay. If we’re taking absolutecosmic certainties out ofequations... I think killing themost evil man on the planet andsparing the world from instabilityand violence would make us prettypopular.(then)And it would be the one sociallyresponsible thing we’ve ever done.DAVESee?SETHAnd since we’re in a pretenduniverse, let’s make it easy.We’ll mail Kim the bullet with avery polite letter requesting thathe insert it into his brain. Dave,there’s no WAY we could get out ali-DAVEAll I’m saying is let’s meet withthe CIA and hear the plan. If itsounds risky, we don’t sign on.SETH(stoic)Sure. Fine. I’ll meet with them.DAVEAwesome!THE INTERVIEW 33.3/15/12SETHBut I say who needs the CIA? Inour new universe, we can just sendKim a banana peel, and tell him toput it on his staircase. No, wait:we send him rocket-powered rollerskates... with no helmet!As Seth continues to amuse himself, Dave picks up the phone..INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYDave and Seth sit at a conference table with Agents Lacey andGregory. On a DRY ERASE BOARD, “MISSION BASICS: TRUST” iswritten.AGENT LACEYKim has every reason to trust youboys. To him, you’re no threatbecause your backgrounds show zerointerest in politics. You’vecommitted yourselves to no causesof any kind, not even aneighborhood beautificationprogram. You don’t appear to careabout anything or anyone butyourselves.SETH(annoyed)Are you going somewhere with this?AGENT LACEYYou need to maintain thatappearance.Dave raises his hand.DAVEI’m sorry, this is unrelated, Ijust... Agent Lacey, where are yourglasses?Agent Lacey looks a bit caught. Then, confidently:AGENT LACEYI got Lasik.Dave turns to Seth and gives him a look of acknowledgment.Lacey opens a small pewter case, and with a tweezers, holdsup a tiny PINKISH STRIP.THE INTERVIEW 34.3/15/12AGENT LACEY (CONT’D)Meet your equipment: the UTR.Undetectable Transdermal Time-Delayed Ricin Strip. It’s got twolayers: the first, a protectivebacking that adheres to the skin onthe palm of your hand. The second,a flesh-colored film soaked inricin, the deadliest poisonavailable.SETHIt’s so tiny - that’s really enoughto kill a man?AGENT LACEYIt’s enough to kill 50. It’s onlythis big for ease of handling.Seth looks impressed - this could actually work.AGENT LACEY (CONT'D)Our engineers have created asolution that absorbs through skincontact, and metabolizes over aperiod of 72 hours. This meansDave can shake the enemy’s hand,and be off North Korean soil daysbefore the enemy is K.I.A. Thebest part: it can never be provedthat you did it.This takes Dave by surprise.DAVEEven if someone told people I didit?AGENT LACEYMany people will never believe it.It’ll stay in the fringe world ofconspiracy theorists. And that’sexactly how we need it - the UnitedStates government must have totaldeniability.Dave suddenly looks disheartened.INT. DAVE’S RANGE ROVER - NIGHTSeth and Dave head home after the first day of training.THE INTERVIEW 35.3/15/12SETHThis feels so foreign to me as Isay it, but the C.I.A. is awesome.I mean, we can actually do this andnot wind up with our skulls beingused for Communist Party ash trays.DAVEYeah.Seth looks at Dave.SETHWhat’s with you? Where’s theboundless enthusiasm?Dave says nothing. He’s thinking hard.SETH (CONT’D)Don’t tell me you’re upset aboutthe honeypot thing.DAVENo. It’s not that.(sighs)It’s this whole plan. It’s notwhat I envisioned. I thought I wasgonna be on live TV, and rightthere in front of the entire worldI’d slay that evil bastard.SETHSlay? Like with a magic sword?Like King Arthur?DAVENo, with a gun.SETHYeah, well, the neat thing aboutdeath is that it works great inwhatever form you get it.DAVEThis is a television event. We livein a visually oriented culture. Anoff-camera death is anticlimactic.Seth doesn’t argue.THE INTERVIEW 36.3/15/12DAVE (CONT'D)But if I pull out a gun and blowthat monster away at point blankrange, it’s the biggest event sincethe dawn of motion pictures.SETHSo... you only want to kill him ifyou get credit for it.DAVEWell are we really gonna go all theway over there and risk our asses,and not get anything out of it?SETHHow about a safer planet?DAVEThe planet thing is great. But ifpeople also know we did it, we’reinstantly historic figures. Nomatter what we do for the rest ofour lives, we’ll always be heroes.Like Neil Armstrong. He walked onthe moon 40 years ago and they’restill sucking his dick.SETHAh, yes, the dick. And the suckingthereof...INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAYDave conveys his ideas to and Agents Lacey and Gregory.DAVE... And the gun should be a nickleplatedrevolver. It’ll pick uplight more nicely than somethingblack with a matte finish.The agents are speechless.DAVE (CONT’D)Look, I’m not trying to be a primadonna. I’m just responding as amedia professional to the fact thatwe live in a visual culture.Lacey is too annoyed to speak. She yields to Agent Gregory.THE INTERVIEW 37.3/15/12AGENT GREGORYFirst of all, there’s the challengeof smuggling a firearm into a highsecurity compound in a foreigncountry. Then there’s thecounterattack you’ll face uponfiring your weapon. Should yousurvive that, there’s the matter ofyour exfiltration from the site.We’re talking air support,extraction teams, naval battlegroup, overhead reconnaissance.With the hardware, training,personnel and logistics, you’vejust increased the cost of thisoperation from 7 million dollars tonearly 1 billion.A beat.DAVEStill seems like a bargain forridding the world of Kim.AGENT LACEYThe answer is no.DAVEI see. Well, that’s disappointing.I thought this was a collaboration.(gets up)But since I don’t feel respected,it’s hard to maintain enthusiasmfor this project.Dave heads for the door.DAVE (CONT'D)(turns to Lacey)And by the way, not that it’s thebiggest deal, but you did honeycombme.(off Lacey’s confusion)The fake glasses?SETH“Honeypot”, Dave. Not “honeycomb.”DAVEWhatever. It was insulting.Dave exits. The room sits in stunned silence.THE INTERVIEW 38.3/15/12INT. CIA OFFICE - DAYAgents Lacey and Gregory are with the DEPUTY DIRECTOR.AGENT LACEYSkylark’s a showman, and he wantsit to be a show.DEPUTY DIRECTORWhat’s his buddy Rapoport say?AGENT GREGORYHe says Skylark’s been completelyirrational ever since he found somegrey hairs on his head. It’s allsome kind of mid-life crisis thing.The director SIGHS. Then:DEPUTY DIRECTORLet’s say we had the funding, isthere a plan that achieves theobjective and gets them out alive?AGENT LACEYTheoretically. But their chance ofsurvival drops to about 50 percent.The director rubs his temples in exasperation.DEPUTY DIRECTORDoes Skylark get that this makeshim the world’s single biggestliving asshole?AGENT GREGORYWe imparted that information tohim.DEPUTY DIRECTORWhat was his response?AGENT GREGORYTo paraphrase, “No, you’re theasshole.”INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHTSeth and Dave argue.SETHWhat does SEAl Team 6 have to dowith us?!THE INTERVIEW 39.3/15/12DAVEThey prove that our military knowshow to do this shit now. Thatpirate takedown, the Bin Ladenraid, Saddam, Ghaddfi - we got themall without the loss of a singleAmerican life, and not with somepussy-assed poison strip.SETHWe’re not Navy SEALs! Do you getthat?DAVEYes. I’m saying we would work withguys like that on the mission.SETHThere is no mission. The CIA toldus to go fuck ourselves.DAVEThey’ll come back to us. They’rejust testing our commitment.(off Seth’s look)Oh, you think the C.I.A. doesn’tplay mind games?SETHI think they’re genuinely not intowasting taxpayer money and gettingyou killed. I think the CIA hasactually learned from experiencenot to take massive risks thatcould backfire and lead tounspeakable tragedy.We see the HEADLIGHTS of a PHALANX OF VEHICLES pulling up thedriveway. We hear a HELICOPTER.SETH (CONT’D)What the...?POUNDING on the door. Seth answers. It’s Agents Lacey andGregory.DAVEHey!AGENT LACEYWe’ve revised the operation plan toaccommodate Mr. Skylark’s request.THE INTERVIEW 40.3/15/12DAVEAre you serious?!AGENT LACEYThe new plan requires intensivetraining and education. To achieveadequate preparation by D-Day,we’ll need to leave for thetraining facility in Hertsford,North Carolina. Tonight.SETHHold on. You’re saying you have aplan that allows Dave to shoot thedictator of North Korea in his ownhouse, and he and I both get outalive?AGENT LACEYYes. We have a plan.SETHWhat’s our estimated chance ofsurvival?AGENT LACEYNinety-six percent.SETHOh, come on. Ninety-six?AGENT LACEYNinety. Six.SETHThat’s nine, six?DAVESeth, come on. She said--SETHJesus, Dave! Hold on! It’s ourlives they’re fucking with. BeforeI decide on anything, I have theright to get all the facts, andmake an informed decision.DAVEYou’re right. That’s fair.SETHThank you.(then, to Lacey)Ninety-six??THE INTERVIEW 41.3/15/12AGENT LACEYYour time is up. You wanna do thisand make it back alive, we leavenow. Chopper’s waiting.SETHOkay, can we just talk ab--DAVEHe said okay!AGENT LACEY(signaling to someoneoutside)Go! Go!SETHWait, what??MEN rush Dave and Seth out the door and into a LANDING CIATRANSPORT HELICOPTER.INT. HELICOPTER - LATERAs the chopper makes its way toward Vandenberg Air ForceBase, Seth and Dave sit quietly. Seth looks MURDEROUS.Finally, Dave breaks the silence:DAVEI can tell you’re mad at me.SETHWho’s denying that? I hate yourfucking guts.DAVEBut why?SETHI guess it’s the fact that you’reforcing me to die before I’ve hadchildren.DAVEForcing? Seth, you’ve got powerhere. I can’t do it without you.If you bail, it ends.SETHAnd if it ends, Kim lives, andcontinues to slaughter innocentpeople and threaten the world.THE INTERVIEW 42.3/15/12DAVETrue. True.(musing)It’s kinda funny, isn’t it? Thefate of millions of people - in away, it all depends on us.SETHOh, it’s a riot.(then)Less hilarious is how you’ve put mein a totally fucked position.Dave’s bummed. He can’t take Seth’s wrath. He thinks insilence for a few beats. An idea:DAVEListen. I’ll make you a deal. Youget on board for the training. Imean really give it everything. Ifat the end, you’re still againstthe gun plan, I’ll... I’ll agree tothe poison plan.Seth begins to thaw. He NODS almost imperceptibly in grumpyagreement.INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAYDave and Seth are lectured by a SPECIAL OPS INSTRUCTOR.SPEC OPS INSTRUCTORSkylark will dispatch the enemy--(holds up a SILVER GUN)--with this modified Sig Sauerp226. The weapon will bedismantled into 137 separate piecesso as to avoid detection duringyour luggage search. You willassemble it upon arrival.(continues)The bullet itself cannot besmuggled. Even trace amounts ofexplosives can be detected bycanines. Therefore, gentlemen,(holds up a BULLET)this round will be encased in animpact-resistant tube outfittedlaser-guidance and parachute, andlaunched from a P-3 Orion planeover the Sea of Japan.(holds up the MICRO DRONE,gets in Dave’s face)THE INTERVIEW 43.3/15/12(MORE)Total line item cost of deliveringthis single 9 millimeter, hollowpoint bullet: 200 million dollars.The instructor stares daggers at Dave, until finally:DAVEYou have to understand, we live ina visual culture, so when we’re--SETHNo. Don’t do that. Don’t saystuff like that to these people.INT. ANOTHER TRAINING ROOM - DAYSPEC OPS INSTRUCTOR #2Prior to Skylark killing the enemy,Rapoport will disable all potentialresistance. Using a wristwatchradio controller,(holds up a WATCH)he will activate Sustained SonicBlast Modules which you will plantthroughout the compound in advanceof D-Day. Your hearing protectionwill be inserted prior to H-Hour.At 2,000 decibels, the blast willincapacitate all personnel within100 yards. Activation of theSSBM’s will be Skylark’s cue tofire on the enemy with one shot tothe head. Again using thewristwatch controller, Rapoportwill detonate strategically placedCS teargas pellets(holds up a SMALL WHITEPILL)to halt any personnel who have bythat juncture secured hearingprotection. At that time you willdon concealed polypropelene masks(holds up a GAS MASK)secreted in your body armor. Youwill escape the compound and linkwith a South Korean pararescue teamin the adjacent mountains. Shouldyou fail to link with your team,you must be familiar with survivaltechniques specific to the NorthKorean mountain terrain. ColonelYong will take it from here.THE INTERVIEW 44.3/15/12SPEC OPS INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)A grizzled looking SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY GUY takes over.COLONEL YONGThere is danger from Siberiantiger. My brother encountered oneand had his head torn off. AlsoNorth Korean ranger forces. Theycaptured my cousin. They took himto a room, and then they choppedoff his head. Also land mine. Oneof my men stepped on a mine whichblew off his legs.A beat.DAVE(sighs)Well at least he didn’t--COLONEL YONGAfter that, a tiger came and tookthe head.TRAINING MONTAGE:-Dave FIRES at a HUMAN TARGET DOLL.-Seth and Dave run a COURSE FILLED WITH TEARGAS. They failto properly don their masks before CHOKING on the gas. Theydrop to the ground and WRITHE in AGONY.-Dave FIRES more rounds at the TARGET DOLL.-Seth uses his watch to trigger the SONIC BLAST MODULES. Thevibrations KNOCK SETH AND DAVE to the ground in agony.INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAYSPEC OPS INSTRUCTORIn the event of capture, you do nothave the psychological profiles towithstand torture.(holding it up)This pill contains highlyconcentrated potassium cyanideinside a hard rubber shell. Itmust be crushed between the molars.DAVENo. There’s no way I can actuallykill myself.THE INTERVIEW 45.3/15/12SETHI’m with Dave on this. I mean, howbad would the torture really be?SPEC OPS INSTRUCTORWe know that Kim prefers a methodof sodomy in which the victim’s ownwindpipe is used as the implementof penetration.SETHI’ll take a couple.DAVECrush it with the molars, gotit.INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYFull rehearsal: Seth ACTIVATES the SSBM’s. BEEEEEP! RoleplayingPRESIDENTIAL GUARDS all drop to the floor. DaveWHIPS out the gun and FIRES directly into the head of theLIFELIKE KIM DOLL. Seth activates the TEARGAS. As the roomfills with gas, they don their masks. Dave and Seth “escape”!It’s just a rehearsal but the guys look confident. The wholetraining team APPLAUDS. Dave and Seth high-five. As thetraining team cleans up, Dave and Seth get a moment alone.SETHI feel... shockingly awesome.DAVERight?SETHThe equipment is top notch, theplan is straightforward, we’reinsanely well-rehearsed. I thinkwe can actually pull this off.Shit, I’m actually looking forwardto it.DAVEYes! Me too!(then)Wait... Are we being weirdlyeuphoric about this?SETHMaybe.(then)It’s possible they drugged us.DAVEWhat should we do?THE INTERVIEW 46.3/15/12SETHAt this point? Shut the fuck upand mind our own business.TITLE UP - SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA.EXT. TARMAC, SEOUL AIRPORT - DAYSeth and Dave step off the plane and load into a MILITARYVEHICLE.INT. MILITARY VEHICLE - DAYSeth and Dave are flanked by SOUTH KOREAN SOLDIERS. Theylook out the window to see that they’re approachingTHE KOREAN D.M.Z.It is now TERRIFYINGLY MILITARIZED. DOZENS OF TANKS point ateach other, just feet apart. GIANT MISSILES on launcherspoint toward the sky. Soldiers aim rifles at each other’sfaces from yards apart.Dave and Seth have a VERY WHISPERED exchange:DAVEDude. Look at that shit.SETHI know. If someone farts it couldtrigger a nuclear war.EXT. KOREAN D.M.Z. - DAYUnder the watch of sniper scopes, Dave and Seth are ledacross the DMZ by SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY, and received byNORTH KOREAN MILITARY.Seth and Dave labor to keep calm as CANINES sniff their bagsand MAGNETOMETER WANDS glide up and down their bodies. Theycheck out okay, and are loaded into a BLACK VAN.INT. VAN/EXT. THE WOODS - LATERSeth and Dave are flanked by guards as the vehicle windsalong a back road. It’s quiet and tense. The van pulls offthe road and into the WOODS.This can’t be right. Seth and Dave both look freaked.THE INTERVIEW 47.3/15/12GUARD #1You two. Step out of the vehicle.DAVEUh, can I ask what for?GUARD #1(raising his GUN)Step out of the vehicle now.Seth and Dave step out of the van.GUARD #1 (CONT’D)Remove your clothing.SETH(sotto)They’re really gonna do it.They’re gonna cut off our dicks andstuff them in our mouths.DAVENo, remember? They’re gonna cutout our windpipes and shove them up-GUARD #1Clothes off!Dave and Seth strip NAKED and try not to weep.GUARD #1 (CONT’D)We are going to President Kim’sprivate compound, we must maintainthe secrecy of its location. Inthe event you have swallowed atracking device, we will cycle yourmetabolism before going further.SETH“Cycle our metabolism”?GUARD #2(hands them GLASSES OFCLEAR LIQUID)Drink this.DAVEWhat is this stuff?SETHMaybe it’s an aperitif before afive course lunch.THE INTERVIEW 48.3/15/12EXT. THE WOODS - LATERSeth and Dave are naked, squatting on a FALLEN LOG, theirasses hanging over the back. They’re drenched in sweat andin AGONY. Their conversation is interrupted by as muchEXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA as can be managed without hurting comedy.DAVEUHHUHUH! Why couldn’t they havelet us do this in a bathroom?SETHNo, it’s better without the toilet.UHUHUH! The propulsive force istoo powerful; there would’ve been asplashback situation. UHUHUHUH!FLIES buzz.DAVEUHHH! I don’t even understand whatcould be coming out of me. It’sgotta be organs. I gotta look.SETHDo NOT look back there! You can’thandle it. Just let it go.DAVEUHHUH!SETHUHUHUH!DAVEUHHH-ARRRGHHHH!Dave and Seth catch their breath for a moment.DAVE (CONT’D)We’re having diarrhea in NorthKorea.SETHI’m just glad they didn’t shove mythroat up my ass.Desperately in need of cheer, they start to GIGGLEDELIRIOUSLY, under the disapproving stares of the guards.THE INTERVIEW 49.3/15/12INT. VAN - LATE AFTERNOONSeth and Dave are both GHOST WHITE and barely alive fromdehydration and poisoning.The van pulls up to a what appears to be an OVERGROWNHEDGEROW. The driver punches buttons on his dash, andsuddenly the hedgerow RETRACTS, revealing a secret driveway.EXT. KIM COMPOUND - LATE AFTERNOONA sprawling complex in the mountains. With a soft gaze, itis beautiful and peaceful. With sharper focus, there arecamouflaged cameras, watchful guards, hidden sniperemplacements and anti-aircraft batteries.The van pulls up to the MAIN HOUSE. The guys, who can barleywalk or even stand up, are helped out of the van.ORDERLY ROWS of DIGNITARIES, SERVANTS, SOLDIERS and GUARDSline the grand steps. There appears to be an imminentceremony... to herald the arrival of Dave and Seth?MILITARY OFFICER(to his troops)Men, take aim!Dave and Seth look to each other - what the fuck is going on?DAVE(points)Oh shit!Seth looks: THREE LARGE CANNONS point at them!MILITARY OFFICERFire!DAVE Ahhhgh!! SETH NOOO!! BOOM!! CONFETTI EXPLODES from the cannons, creating a showerof colorful fluttering paper. A MARCHING BAND starts up asmore confetti explodes.A TROUPE OF ACROBATIC DANCING GIRLS cartwheels onto thelanding, executing stunning feats of synchronization andweightlessness to the rhythm of the drums and horns.DAVEThis is for us?THE INTERVIEW 50.3/15/12They see A SPECTACULAR MOTORCADE on its way: first, a CONVOYof MOTORCYCLES. Then, HORSES IN ANCIENT WARRIOR REGALIA.Then, FERRARIS with ROOF-MOUNTED MACHINE GUN TURRETS. Thenthe longest SUV STRETCH LIMO you’ve ever seen.Guards open the limo doors and PRESIDENT KIM STEPS OUT. Hemajestically waves to his weeping, applauding subjects.DAVE (CONT’D)(sotto to Seth)This is the welcome he gets forshowing up at his country house?SETHHe’s the boss. It’s the welcome hegives himself.A magnificent TRUMPET FANFARE plays as Kim parades right pastSeth and Dave - no acknowledgment of his conspicuous Americanguests - and marches into the residence. Once the presidentdisappears into the building, the crowd rapidly melts away.The guards step to Seth and Dave:GUARD #1Get your bags and walk.SETHI can’t. I’m too weak fromdehydration. Can someone carrymine? Or get me a glass of water?GUARD #1You’re Americans. If you arestrong enough to tell the worldwhat to do, you’re strong enough tocarry your suitcase to your room.Seth grumpily picks up his bags, Dave does too. They staggerand limp, across a long field toward the guest quarters.INT. COMPOUND MESS - NIGHTDave and Seth eat in the mess with the other compoundpersonnel. Dave looks unhappy with his food.DAVEWhat is this stuff? Where’s alltheir famously awesome sushi?THE INTERVIEW 51.3/15/12SETHDave. That’s Japan. You knowthat’s not the country we’re in,right?DAVEYeah, of course, but I just thoughtthey all kinda... So what’s the bigthing they serve here?SETHFermented cabbage.DAVEFuck me.SETHYou alright, man?DAVEI think I’m just a littleoverwhelmed mentally.(then sotto)I’m gonna kill a man tomorrow.SETHYeah... That’s intense.(then)What’s it feel like?DAVEI’m ready. It’s just strange -before, he was just this globalsuper villain. But the whole wayhe arrived, the way we’ve beentreated - now I hate him on apersonal level. I wonder if when Ishoot him, will it feel like I’mkilling an evil dictator, or justsome guy I happen to think is anasshole?SETH(impressed)You really are gettingcontemplative lately.DAVEI know. In another year I’m gonnabe like the Buddha or some shit.THE INTERVIEW 52.3/15/12INT. SETH’S GUEST ROOM - NIGHTSeth changes into ALL-BLACK CLOTHING in preparation for NIGHTSTALKING. Meanwhile, Dave scans the outside with lowprofile,futuristic NIGHT VISION DEVICES.SETHHow’s the weather for me out there?DAVEI’m counting seventeensharpshooters.SETHWhat? That is so way more than theestimates. What the fuck?!DAVEChrist, can you imagine if they allfired on you at once? Your bodywould look like clam chowder.Seth looks at Dave in outrage.DAVE (CONT’D)Shit. Sorry. Not helpful.(then)Look, this is silly. It was myidea. It should be me out thererisking my ass. I’ll retrieve thebullet.SETHNo. If something goes wrong andyou get hurt or killed, this thingis over. And if it’s over, Kimlives, the world’s fucked and myentire life amounts to a pile ofbeaver shit.A BEEP. Seth looks at his MISSION WATCH. An ordinarylooking watch until Seth flips the LID up to reveal a HIGHTECHCOMMUNICATIONS SCREEN. It reads “135.1025.”SETH (CONT’D)(growing anxiety)JSOC confirm code. They’re clearto launch the bullet. They’rewaiting on coordinates from us.DAVEDon’t spiral. Just fall back onthe training.THE INTERVIEW 53.3/15/12While Seth collects himself, Dave pulls out a CAMERA BATTERYLIKEDEVICE secreted in a FLASHLIGHT.DAVE (CONT’D)I’ll get the locator beacon deepinto the field. Remember: threatsdon’t emanate from the middle of ameadow 100 yards inside a walledcompound. There’s no moon,(re: night vision device)and the snipers don’t have these.So as long as you stay low, moveslow, and keep quiet, you should begood. Cool?Seth gives a semi-convincing thumbs up.Dave goes to the window and HURLS THE BEACON. It’s anawesome, athletic throw. It lands somewhere in the DARKNESS.SETHNice toss.DAVEMove out. I got you covered.Dave pulls the NIGHT VISION GLASSES back over his eyes.Seth, looking BUMMED AS SHIT, gingerly steps outside, DROPSTO HIS BELLY, CRAWLS THROUGH GRASS in short bursts, sniperstyle,and disappears into the moonless void.From hereon, Dave and Seth communicate via their WRISTWATCHESAND EARPIECES.From the safety of the room Dave alternates his scan vianight vision: he observes the guards, then observes Seth’smovements, back and forth, making sure Seth heads in theright direction, and that guards do not detect Seth.DAVE (CONT’D)You’re clear, move.Seth crawls a few feet into the field. Dave scans the guardactivity again - they are not observing.DAVE (CONT’D)Clear. Move.Seth moves a few feet forward.SETHI can’t see a fucking thing outhere. This sucks.THE INTERVIEW 54.3/15/12DAVEI’m your eyes. Just go straightahead. Clear. Move.Seth crawls a few feet more.DAVE (CONT’D)Okay, hold your position. You’re20 yards from the landing site.You don’t wanna get hit.SETHHow much longer?Dave checks his watch. It reads 00:00:55.DAVELess than a minute. Stand by.Dave notices a CREATURE enter his field of vision. Thecreature is MOVING TOWARD SETH.DAVE (CONT’D)Shit.(to Seth)Buddy, you’re not alone.SETHI’m not?? Who’s there??Dave gets a better look: it’s a SIBERIAN TIGER. (They arerare but indigenous to North Korea.)DAVEIt’s a tiger.SETHCome on, don’t mess around.DAVEI’m not. It’s a tiger, and it’smoving toward you. Be still.A beat.SETHAre you fucking kidding me?DAVENo.SETHThey didn’t say anything to usabout tigers!THE INTERVIEW 55.3/15/12DAVEYes they did. Remember ColonelYong? He said a whole thing about--Seth hears the TIGER’S BREATH. He spins around and sees it.SETHOh, fuck fuck fuck fuck.DAVENo, dude. Do not freak out.That’s not gonna help.The tiger GROWLS WITH PREDATORY LUST.SETH(jumps to his FEET)Aaah!DAVENo! Stay down! They’ll spot you!The tiger ROARS!SETH(to the tiger)GO AWAY!! GET OUT OF HERE!! GETOUT YOU FUCKING BITCH!!DAVESeth! Jesus! Be quiet!WHACK!! The tiger SMACKS Seth in the head with his paw,knocking him to the ground.DAVE (CONT’D)Oh shit!The tiger climbs over Seth, straddling him, about to make hiskill, when-- WHUMP!! The MINI DRONE LANDS ON THE TIGER’SHEAD. The tiger drops (ON TOP OF SETH), DEAD. Sethstruggles to get out from under the 500 pound beast.SETH (V.O.)(muffled under tiger)Mmf! Mmnfrfmph!We hear the JSOC OPERATOR over Dave’s earpiece:AGENT LACEY (V.O.)Loading Bay for Triple Axle.THE INTERVIEW 56.3/15/12DAVETriple Axle reading you five byfive.From under the dead tiger, we see HANDS AND ARMS squeeze out,and struggle to push the tiger corpse off.AGENT LACEY (V.O.)Do you have a visual on thepackage?DAVEAffirmative. But Seth’s having apretty rough time.Seth continues to struggle. At this point it’s a raceagainst his own suffocation clock.AGENT LACEY (V.O.)Can you describe the problem?DAVEYes, I’d say in our training therewasn’t enough emphasis on physicalstrength.Seth, through sheer determination, at last, ROLLS THE DEADTIGER OFF OF HIM, and springs into action.Seth grabs the mini drone, cracks it open, and there it is:one 9MM BULLET. He takes it and tosses the drone into somebushes.By now SHARPSHOOTERS have spotted the commotion in the field,and train their weapons on the site as they radio for areaction force.We hear RAPID FOOTSTEPS in the hall. Guards on their way torespond to the commotion!AGENT LACEY (V.O.)Triple Axle, are you in possessionof the article?DAVESeth just retrieved it.Seth takes the bullet and SHOVES IT UP HIS ASS.AGENT LACEY (V.O.)Has he cached it in a secure place?A beat.THE INTERVIEW 57.3/15/12AGENTY LACEY (V.O.)Repeat: has he cached the articlein a secure place?DAVEI heard you. I’m still ponderingthe question.Seth is suddenly BLINDED by HIGH INTENSITY FLASH LIGHTS.GUARD #1STOP!10 RIFLES are pointed at Seth from 10 feet away. Seth putshis hands up. He is standing next to a DEAD TIGER.GUARD #1 (CONT’D)What are you doing?SETH‘M ffrah--(spits out clumps of TIGERFUR)I’m sorry! I... I heard someoneoutside.(re: tiger)It was him.The guards look to each other.GUARD #1What happened to the animal?SETHI uh... I killed him.GUARD #1You have a weapon?SETHNo! It was a lucky punch. I fakedhim out. I think he’s old or...maybe developmentally challenged?GUARD #1Remove your clothing.Seth almost starts to argue, but there’s no point. Withresignation, he once again starts REMOVING HIS CLOTHING.INT. DAVE’S GUEST ROOM - LATERDave talks through the door to Seth, who’s in the bathroom.THE INTERVIEW 58.3/15/12DAVEThe retarded tiger story. To sellthat takes talent. And I’ve neverseen a foreign object shoved thatquickly - and deeply - up a man’sasshole. If you could handle lessthan 10 hours of sleep, you’d begood CIA.Seth opens the door and presents the BULLET.SETHHere’s your 200 million dollarbullet, shit wad. Don’t miss.DAVE(revolted)Did you clean it off?SETHNot a chance. If that’s going intoKim’s brain, it goes withwhatever’s on it.INT. DAVE’S ROOM - MORNINGDave’s woken by KNOCKING. He staggers to the door and opensit to find... PRESIDENT KIM.KIMGood morning, Mr. Skylark. May Icome in?Dave looks freaked, but with no choice, leads Kim in.KIM (CONT'D)I wish to apologize. I know thatmy men were strict with youyesterday. And my reception of youboth was lacking in warmth.DAVEA little, yeah.KIMYour presence here is a delicateissue. Unfortunately, the peopleof this country, and myadministration, hate Americans.(then)THE INTERVIEW 59.3/15/12(MORE)And to be completely honest: theysee you, personally, as a symbol ofeverything that is wrong withAmerican culture. I’m sorry tosay.DAVEThat’s okay. Lately Americanswould agree.KIMBut I am a fan. The Teri Hatcherinterview was outstanding.DAVEYou saw it?KIMIt was both moving and...titillating.DAVEYes - yes, that’s exactly what wewere going for!INT. CONTROL ROOM, BROADCAST STUDIO - DAYSook gives Seth a tour. The equipment is all state of theart. Vigilant GUARDS keep a respectful distance. (The sameones who forced Seth and Dave to strip naked in the woodsyesterday. And forced Seth to strip again last night.)SOOKOn the day, the control room willbe fully staffed to ensure anuninterrupted transmission of oursignal to the satellite.Seth subtly puts his hand in his pocket. A moment later, aSMALL BLACK DISK drops from his pant leg. A sonic blastmodule. He gently nudges it under the console, out of sight.SOOK (CONT’D)As you know, we will not allowcommunication between you and Mr.Skylark during the interview. Buthis questions will be available tohim on a Teleprompter.(then)Can he, in fact, read English?SETHCan he... I don’t understand.THE INTERVIEW 60.3/15/12KIM (CONT'D)SOOKThere are many kinds ofintelligence. My intuition is thatthe kind related to literacy isperhaps not one Mr. Skylarkpossesses?Seth looks at her, searching. Then he starts to LAUGH.SETHWait... that’s a joke... You’refunny! That’s so weird.SOOKYou presumed I was a humorlessfunctionary?SETHUm, well, you dragged me 8,000miles across the world to a desertfor a 45 second conversation, andyou didn’t offer me a cup of tea.So, to be accurate, I presumed youwere an asshole.SOOK(laughs)I greatly admired your courage inmaking that journey, Mr. Rapoport.SETH(softening)Thanks.SOOKI imagine you would make anexcellent reporter of seriousinternational news.(then)I mean... should you ever wish tomake such a transition.SETHYeah.SOOKOf course, your job now is solucrative and secure. No doubtyou’re sufficiently content.Seth looks to Sook with admiration.THE INTERVIEW 61.3/15/12SETHYou’re quite the shit-stirrer,aren’t you?Sook smiles. Is there maybe a little chemistry happen--The GUARDS have become alarmed by the flirtation level.GUARD #1It is time for Mr. Rapoport’slunch.SETHThat’s okay. I’m not actuallyhungry right now, so--GUARD #1This is the designated time forguests to receive meals.They march a very bummed Seth out of the room.INT. SALON - DAYA private tour of the residence. Kim leads Dave down anornate hallway. They arrive at a small gallery - the wallsare a museum of ANTIQUE PHOTOS OF MATRONLY KOREAN WOMEN.KIMWhat do you suppose each of thesebeautiful women have in common?Dave looks at the photographs thoughtfully.DAVEWait... Did you tap all that ass?KIMI beg your pardon?DAVEForgive me. Did you lay with them?KIMNo. They are my ancestors, all ofwhom were raped and murdered byJapanese imperialists.DAVEOh man, that sucks.THE INTERVIEW 62.3/15/12KIMFor 35 years the Japanese occupiedKorea, enslaved our men for hardlabor, and our women for sex.DAVEThose bastards. I had no idea.KIMOf course not. No one remembersKorean history. If they did, theworld might better understand us.They might sympathize with ourdesire for a strong militarydefense. Perhaps they would notperceive us as a global menace, butmerely as a people determined neverto be treated like animals again.DAVEYeah, well, sadly, nobody asksabout these things.KIMMr. Skylark, you will ask. Thequestions I’ve prepared for theinterview - they’re about thecenturies of suffering andoccupation of our country.DAVEOh. That’s cool! So it’ll sortabe like... like a history lesson?KIMExactly. Mr. Skylark, I trulybelieve that if you can understandKorean history, anyone can.DAVEThank you, Mr. President, thatmeans a lot to me.(notices through thewindow)Whoa... Is that real?Through the window, we see a WORLD WAR II ERA TANK, housed ina hangar.KIMIt was a gift to my father fromJoseph Stalin.THE INTERVIEW 63.3/15/12DAVEGet out!KIMThat very tank was used in theBattle of Berlin - the one thatdefeated Hitler.DAVEShut. The fuck. Up.(then)What’s it like to ride in one?Does it still work?Kim smiles.INT. TANK FIGHTING COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATERDave and Kim are inside the tank. It’s AWESOME! Kim pullsout a VINTAGE TANK SHELL.KIMAn original BR-471 armor piercinground.DAVEIs it still live?Kim smiles devilishly and LOADS it into the chamber.KIMThere is only one modification tothis vehicle.(re: a STEREO PANEL)Harmon Kardon stereo.(then)Do you enjoy John Mellencamp?DAVEWell, you know, he’s... I’ve nevertried him in a tank.Kim hits a button, and up comes “AUTHORITY SONG.” It’s loudand Dave finds the groove. Kim then produces a PINT-SIZEDBOTTLE OF COGNAC. Dave smiles...EXT. FIELD - SAMEThe tank ROARS out of the hangar and out onto the wide openfields of the property. It swerves like crazy - Kim and Daveare having fun.THE INTERVIEW 64.3/15/12INT. TANK FIGHTING COMPARTMENT - SAMEThe MUSIC is blasting. Dave is driving and having a ball.KIMFire in the hole!EXT. FIELD - SAMEKA-BOOM!! A GLOWING TRACER ROUND shoots out of the tank andEXPLODES on the distant mountain face.The tank barrels across the acres as the guys HOOT andHOLLER. Security runs alongside trying to keep up. The tankFIRES another round. KA-BOOM!!EXT. FIELD - DAYKim and Dave struggle to climb out of the tank. They are nowBLASTED, swigging from fifth of Johnny Walker and LAUGHINGtheir ass off.Suddenly Dave REACHES for KIM’S HEAD. The nearby Guardsbecome alarmed and move in.Dave PLUCKS A GRAY HAIR off Kim’s head.BODYGUARDStop!!Dave spins around to see TWO RIFLES pointed at him.DAVEOh my god, I’m sorry! It’s... it’sjust a reflex lately.Dave shows the gray hair to Kim. Kim begins to LAUGH.KIMAll morning, I have wanted to dothis:Kim reaches out and PLUCKS ONE OF DAVE’S GRAY HAIRS. Heshows it to Dave. The two of them LAUGH.KIM (CONT'D)Mine started a year ago.DAVETwo months ago for me. I’m sobummed.THE INTERVIEW 65.3/15/12(MORE)It’s like - this shit has to startnow? Just when I’m feeling vital?KIMIt’s a peculiar precondition ofexistence: at the moment we masterlife, we fail to enjoy it becausedeath reveals to us its intention.DAVEYes! Exactly! That’s so genius.They both take another swig of Johnny Walker. Kim leans in,and confides to Dave, quietly so the guards don’t hear:KIM(sotto)But I still get so much pussy.DAVEI cannot even imagine.KIMI bet you do well, too.DAVEOh, I do. But it’s gotta benothing compared to you. I mean -you’re the fucking man!KIMYou know Sook - my communicationsdirector?DAVEShe is ri-DICULOUS. You hit that??KIMShe is like a wild animal.Dave drops to his knees and starts mock worshipping.Kim turns to his guards and motions them to beat it. Theylook displeased, but Kim motions them, this time visiblylosing patience. They exit. Kim BECKONS Dave somewhere...INT. UNDERGROUND DEPOT - DAYA hangar warehousing INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.Dave stares at them in drunken awe.THE INTERVIEW 66.3/15/12DAVE (CONT'D)DAVEHoly... Are those the nukes?(off Kim’s nod)Why are you showing me these?Kim considers, then:KIMBecause they are awesome and I’mdrunk off my fucking asshole!Dave LAUGHS. Kim suddenly becomes serious:KIM (CONT’D)I never intended to use them on thewest. I acquired them only to makemy nation safer and stronger.DAVEI hear you. I do.KIMMany of my closest colleaguescriticized me for it. They saidthe nukes only make us a biggertarget for the west. They say I’mendangering North Korea. They callme stupid and incompetent.DAVEGod, that’s just like when I toldeverybody we got an interview withyou. One minute America loves me,the next they’re all calling me anidiot! And why? Because I’mtrying to do something cool? Totake my game up a notch?KIMThat’s how it is for men like us.With great power comes loneliness.(laughs)Is it any wonder we drink?(takes another swig)Dave wanders near a NUKE, and stares with fascination.DAVECan I touch it?Kim nods. Dave touches it, and shivers. Kim then drunkenlystraddles a missile, with the CONE just inches past hiscrotch, making it look like a gigantic cock.THE INTERVIEW 67.3/15/12KIMHey ladies! This is my penis! Howdo you like my big penis?Dave COLLAPSES with laughter.INT. DINING ROOM - DAYSeth sits alone at a table, a bowl of hot noodle soup beforehim. The guards sit at a nearby table, ignoring Seth.SETHExcuse me.No response.SETH (CONT’D)Excuse me?Finally a guard turns to Seth, annoyed.SETH (CONT’D)I don’t have a spoon for my soup.GUARD #1We are out of spoons.SETHReally? Not one in the wholecompound?GUARD #2(enjoying himself)North Korea suffers from a terriblespoon shortage.GUARD #1Sadly, it’s not like America, whereif you are a rich capitalist, youcan have 100 spoons while the poorhave none.The Guards turn their back on Seth. Seth looks up at theGIANT, HEROIC PORTRAITS OF KIM and shakes his head indisgust. He subtly drops another SSBM and GAS PELLET fromhis pant leg.INT. PRIVATE LOUNGE - DAYDave and Kim eat from heaping plates of BEAUTIFUL FOOD.THE INTERVIEW 68.3/15/12DAVEHow can there be a famine in yourcountry? These tomatoes are crazyfresh!Four HOT KOREAN WOMEN in LINGERIE enter.DAVE (CONT’D)Whoa... What is this?KIMThe next course, Dave.The women begin UNBUTTONING Dave’s and Kim’s shirts.DAVEOh wow. This is so, so-- wait, canI just finish my salad before westart? It’s so good!The women start unbuttoning Dave’s and Kim’s pants.KIMWe need not wait. Both can happenat once.INT. SETH’S GUEST ROOM - DAY137 GUN PARTS are spread across a desk. It’s a mind-bendingmess. Seth concentrates intensely as he assembles the gun.SETH(reciting from memory)“Place the recoil spring guideplunger spring over recoil springguide plunger...”BOING! The little spring SHOOTS OUT THE WINDOW. It sailsfar into the meadow.SETH (CONT’D)No. Fuck... FUCK...Seth gets up and walks out the door to begin searching forthe goddamned spring.EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUSGUARDS 1 & 2 quickly descend upon Seth, rifles aimed.GUARD #1Stop! Where are you going?THE INTERVIEW 69.3/15/12SETHI... just want some fresh air.GUARD #1You’re not authorized to roam theproperty freely. Get back in yourroom.GUARD #2Pretend you’re in America, whereall property is private and onlythe privileged few may have it.SETHYeah, I get it. We’re assholes.Look, I need to be outside. I havea vitamin D deficiency. If I don’tget 20 minutes of sun per day, Icould die. So if you want me to goback to America and tell everybodythat you deprived me of my basicmedical needs, then go ahead.GUARD #1Very well. Remove your clothing.SETHWhat?GUARD #1For security, we must be certainyou are not concealing weapons.SETHSeriously? That’s three timesyou’ve asked me to get naked. Youmight wanna examine that.The guards remain stoic.SETH (CONT'D)Suit yourself.(taking off his clothes)I’m just saying, in America, you’reallowed whatever lifestyle youwant. Something to consider.INT. PRIVATE LOUNGE - DAYDave and Kim are in a bed naked, with the four women.They’re all playing MORTAL KOMBAT.THE INTERVIEW 70.3/15/12EXT. FIELD - SAMESeth, naked (or in underwear) roams the field under thewatchful eyes of the guards - who are loving this - tryingnot to appear as if he’s searching for a recoil spring. HeSEES IT IN THE GRASS.He nonchalantly sits down. Under the still watchful eyes ofthe guards, he furtively grabs the spring, and starts shovingit in the only hiding place he’s got.SETH(muttering through agony)Motherfucking...INT. SETH’S GUEST ROOM - LATERDave enters, looking spent but blissful. Seth’s assemblingTHE GUN - it’s close to done.DAVEHey, man. How’s your day been?SETHOh, it’s been wonderful. Travelreally changes your perspective.For example, I’ve learned thatNorth Koreans completely fuckinghate us.Dave HICCUPS. Seth looks at him.SETH (CONT’D)Have you been drinking?DAVENot-- you know, not especially.SETH(whatever)On a happier note, I planted theSSBM’s and teargas pellets, sowe’re good for tomorrow. Which I’mreally looking forward to.DAVEYeah.(then)It’s weird, though. I do kindawonder if this is the right thing.A beat.THE INTERVIEW 71.3/15/12SETHYou do?DAVEWell, if you think about it,overthrowing foreign governmentshasn’t always worked out so wellfor America. President Kim told methis great quote from Marx:“History repeats itself, first astragedy, second as farce.”Seth stops what he’s doing and looks at Dave.SETHYou’re quoting Marx now? Somewherebetween breakfast and lunch youbecame a Communist?DAVENo. I’m just saying, it’s a good--SETHDo you understand that this guy isa master at manipulating the media?DAVEMaybe the media’s manipulated him.SETHHuh?DAVEI’m just saying, no one in themedia has ever spent time with theguy. I have. It’s possible thatthey’ve portrayed him unfairly.SETHLet me get this straight: after 38years on earth, you get a moralconscience, and it tells you tospare the life of this asshole?DAVEI’m just thinking, okay? I’msympathetic to people who gettrashed by the media. Look at whatwe just went through. It sucked.SETHNot as much as what happened to thepeople of Yonghung. Ask them howthey feel about your buddy, Kim.THE INTERVIEW 72.3/15/12DAVEYounghung? What’s Yonghung?SNAP. Seth has locked the two assembled components of thegun together. The GUN IS NOW COMPLETE.SETHHere it is, Dave. The billiondollar gun you requested.Dave suddenly looks HAUNTED.A KNOCK on the door scares the shit out of them.GUARD #1 (O.S.)Your attendance is required in thescreening room.Seth scrambles to hide incriminating evidence.DAVEUh, screening? What’s this about?GUARD #1 (O.S.)You are required to view a filmabout cultural and educationalachievements of The Worker’s Partyof North Korea.Seth WINCES...INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAYSeth and Dave are the only audience members in a largescreening room, watching an obnoxious propaganda film: amontage of Kim being triumphant and glorious in a variety ofactivities.NARRATOR (V.O.)Our Beloved Leader is one of theworld’s most accomplished artists.Moreover, he is the most fiercewarrior. As well, he is a geniusat business and also medicine andagriculture.SETH(sotto to Dave)“Moreover, he is champion atfellatio. He can suck a 12 inchcock while ice-skating backwards.”Seth turns to Dave and sees that he looks spooked.THE INTERVIEW 73.3/15/12SETH (CONT’D)Dude? I’m worried about you. Youcan’t lose focus now.DAVEI’m fine. I’m just-- I’m tired. Ijust need to give my brain a rest.Dave notices THE GUARDS across the aisle. They’re tuned out,one of them is POLISHING HIS GUN.DAVE (CONT’D)(spooked, sotto)Is that our gun?SETH(looks)What? Don’t be stupid.DAVEIt looks exactly the same.SETHYou’re getting paranoid.DAVEThey could’ve searched our room.They could be completely fuckingwith us right now.SETHDave. Breathe.DAVE(gets up)I’m gonna get a closer look.SETHAre you crazy? Do not--Dave heads toward the guards. He is so laser-focused on theguard’s gun, that he doesn’t look where he’s going. DaveTRIPS on a chair leg, and STUMBLES... Right into them and--BANG! Accidental discharge! Guard #1 SLUMPS into the aisle.SETH (CONT’D)Oh shit!Guard #2 (who made the discharge) drops to his KNEES, andclings to his dying friend.DYING GUARDApayo. Na jug-eo!THE INTERVIEW 74.3/15/12PRESIDENT KIM and his retinue arrive, disturbed by thegunshot.CRYING GUARDDangsin-eun jug-eumyeon andwae!DYING GUARDDowajuseyo!! Dowaju...He DIES. The room becomes VERY, VERY QUIET.DAVE(abject meekness)I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...CRYING GUARDAndwae!! Andwae!! Andwae!!The crying guard PULLS OUT HIS OWN WEAPON, AND PUTS THEBARREL UP TO HIS OWN HEAD.KIMAndwae!!BANG! He commits suicide. Blood SPATTERS EVERYWHERE,including Dave’s face. Everyone SCREAMS! The guard DROPSDEAD, next to his fallen comrade. Kim drops to his knees andcries out to the heavens:KIM (CONT’D)Dear Confucius, do not let thesetwo men that I love die! Give themback to me! Give them back!The whole room ROCKS with the sound of WAILING and SOBBING.DAVE wails as loud and as hard as anyone. It is just an orgyof human sorrow.INT. DAVE’S GUEST ROOM - LATERDave is on his bed, wrecked from sobbing. Seth enters.SETHThey’re postponing the interview.The president’s too upset today.Dave says nothing.SETH (CONT’D)Hey. Buddy? Say something.DAVEI killed two innocent men.THE INTERVIEW 75.3/15/12SETHThe guy was polishing a loadedweapon. He was careless.This doesn’t help. Seth tries another tack:SETH (CONT’D)Look. They were assholes. Theykept forcing me to get naked forvery murky reasons.DAVEThey were protecting the president -who we’re conspiring to murder.SETHYou don’t understand. They - theydidn’t give me a spoon for my soup.Dave crumples. Seth’s not helping.DAVEI can’t do that to a human beingagain, Seth. No matter who it is.SETH(sighs)Yeah. Death by gun is unbelievablyviolent. I mean, you know it atone level, but then seeing it...DAVEThink of all the wars our countryhas been in. All the people we’vemade die just like those two guys.It’s sick. It’s sick.SETHI’m with you man. Shit’s fuckedup.(grabs a BAG from hispocket)We’ve still got the poison strip.You never have to see him suffer.Dave takes the UTR. He then gets up, crosses to theBATHROOM, and FLUSHES it.SETH (CONT’D)No. You did not just. YOU STUPID,STUPID FUCK! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?THE INTERVIEW 76.3/15/12DAVEThere’s been enough killing overthe past two thousand years!SETHAsshole, what do you think we’retrying to prevent? He’s on thebrink of killing millions ofpeople! Remember? We’re takingone life to save millions! I knowit’s not pleasant for you, butthere’s other people to consider!DAVEWe’re patsies of the C.I.A.!SETHYou’re a patsie of Kim! He boughtyou with a tank ride! The onechance you had to do somethingdecent for humanity, instead ofjust polluting culture, and youliterally flush it down thegoddamned toilet! Christ, I’m suchan idiot for hitching my wagon toyour star. You dragged my careerinto the muck, and now you drag thefate of the world down with us!DAVEWhoa. Let’s just dial it downbefore something hurtful gets said.Seth storms out.INT. KIM’S PERSONAL STUDY - DAYKim is attended to by his TOP GENERALS.GENERAL JONGMr. President, we must arrest them.They are responsible for the deathsof two of our most elite guards!KIMIt was not maliciously intended.Skylark is not a murderer. He is akind man with a compassionateheart.GENERAL JONGMr. President, he is an American!THE INTERVIEW 77.3/15/12KIM(stern)Do you question my ability to judgecharacter?Jong stands down. This conversation is over. Kim and hisguards exit, leaving Jong and LIEUTENANT MIHN alone.GENERAL JONGI will not allow the murder of mymen by American pigs to gounanswered. With sufficientevidence, the president will beforced to arrest them, at the veryleast on charges of spying. Begincompiling all surveillance footagefrom every room in this compound.We will find something.EXT. DOWNTOWN PYONGYANG - DAYSook takes Seth on a tour of the capital city. The streetbustles with INSANELY HAPPY AND ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE. SMILINGUNIFORMED OFFICIALS help the elderly board a gleaming newBUS. BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN play and laugh in a public square.SETHWhy exactly are we here?SOOKThe President wanted you toexperience our beautiful capitolcity of Pyongyang.SETHUh huh.(then)You do know that I know that allthese people are paid actors, thatthis whole thing is a pantomime.You know that people know thesethings about your country, right?A PRETTY YOUNG MOTHER pushing a stroller crosses Seth andSook’s path. She GIGGLES with theatrical volume andexaggerated femininity at something her PERFECT HUSBAND says.SETH (CONT’D)A city with its own laugh track.(shrugs)They could probably spruce upDetroit with something like that.THE INTERVIEW 78.3/15/12Sook ignores Seth, and points to a TOWERING GOLD STATUE.SOOKThis is the largest statue of KimIl-Hwan in all of North Korea.SETHI presume it has magical powers?SOOK(staying on script)Yes. Many sick and injured peoplehave been healed simply by touchingit.SETHWhat about acne? Does it work forthat? How about halitosis?Sook is unable to resist a SMILE.SOOKYes, it works for that. It alsohelps with weight loss. I see youare carrying an extra ten pounds?SETH(grabs his chest, mockwounded)Oh shit!(then)Please. Can we just go to a decentrestaurant and have a drink?Somewhere I can get an hour withouta barrage of state propaganda?SOOKI... I would enjoy that, but thepresident would not approve.SETHWhat is he, your boyfriend?Sook has a sharp twinge of discomfort. Seth hit a nerve.SETH (CONT’D)One drink. I just watched two menget their brains blown out, andwhen you add in jet lag, my nervesare shot.THE INTERVIEW 79.3/15/12INT. PYONGYANG RESTAURANT - DAYSeth and Sook drink beer and talk.SETHI’m not asking for state secrets,just a taste of humanity. Justtell me how you got the job. Dothat, and I’ll tell you everythingabout Dave Skylark. I’ll sell himout like his worst enemy.Seth’s charm has penetrated.SOOKMy family is in the lowest socialranking in North Korea.SETHThey call it “The Hostile Class”,right?SOOKYes. This means that there is nopossibility of advancement. I knewfrom the time I could speak that mylife would be spent in a factory.SETHWhat kind of factory?SOOKThe factory in my village madeuniforms.SETHUniforms for what kind of work?A beat.SOOKFactory work.SETHSo... you would have worn a uniformin a factory where you manufactureduniforms for people to wear infactories?SOOKYes.THE INTERVIEW 80.3/15/12SETHI guess after the first few weeksyou would’ve stopped appreciatingthe irony.SOOKOne day, officials from the WorkersParty came to my classroom on asearch for young women to serve onthe personal staff of Kim Il-Hwan.They selected me. It was a greathonor. Over the years, I becameclose with the president. He is acharming man. He changed my life,he changed my destiny.SETHYeah. I’ve sorta got a guy likethat in my life.SOOKYou’ve been with Mr. Skylark a longtime.SETHHe’s a hard man to leave.SOOKBut you did try. In 2005 you tooka job with the Washington Post.You lasted five months.SETHYou really do your homework. Yeah.I saw myself as a more seriousjournalist. Just like you’dguessed about me. God, you’resmart.Sook blushes, and bashfully looks away. She’s adorable whenshe’s vulnerable.SETH (CONT’D)The problem is, serious journalistsget treated like serious shit.SOOKOr perhaps you just have difficultywith authority?SETHI... I don’t think that’s true.Dave and I get along great.THE INTERVIEW 81.3/15/12SOOKAnd who in that relationship isreally the boss?SETHWell...SOOKPerhaps at the Washington Post, youwere truly an employee. You wererequired to prove yourself, whereasat “Skylark Tonight” you are themaster.Seth shakes his head. She’s totally got his number.SETHCome to the States. You can chargeby the hour for this kind of stuff.INT. DAVE’S GUEST ROOM - DAYDave lies in bed, looking haunted. Finally he sits up. Heflips the lid on his mission watch, and presses a button.DAVEThis is Triple Axle, does anyonecopy?INT. JSOC COMMAND HEADQUARTERS - SAMELooks like the NASA mission control center. Banks ofmonitors, UNIFORMED MEN with headsets.AGENT LACEYThis is Loading Bay. You’re comingin five by five.DAVEListen, I’m sorry to do this but...I just wanted to let you know thisis a code 13.AGENT LACEY(alarmed)Please repeat.DAVECode 13.By now, JSOC operators of varying rank have gathered around.TRACKING MAPS of Dave and Seth are now on the big screen.THE INTERVIEW 82.3/15/12JSOC OPERATOR(to the other officers)He’s calling mission abort!The call is now on SPEAKER so the whole room can hear.AGENT LACEYTriple Axle, have you beencompromised?DAVENo. I just don’t feel like doingit anymore.AGENT LACEYWhat the... Are you out of yourfucking mind?DAVEI believe killing is immoral. I’msorry - I should have realized thatbefore. I know you put a lot ofwork into this, and I know howdisappointed you must be, so I’dlove to take you guys out fordinner, and express in person howmuch I appre--AGENT LACEYGod DAMNIT! The president of theUnited States is counting on this.You WILL execute this mission, or--DAVELook, I've had a fun life, but it'sbeen light on meaning, and I can’tcap it off with a murder, even of areally douchey guy. Sorry.Dave CUTS COMMUNICATION.INT. PYONGYANG BAR - NIGHTSeth and Sook continue to drink. They’re good and tipsy.SETHOkay. Forgive me if I’m crossing aline here, but... You’re scarysmart. And you’re an independentthinker. You must see that yourboss is a complete dick. Right?THE INTERVIEW 83.3/15/12Sook stares at him, but doesn’t respond. Seth’s MISSIONWATCH beeps.SETH (CONT’D)Uh... Shit, I forgot, I gotta makea call. Would you excuse me?SOOKYou don’t have a phone, remember?We confiscated it until you’re backacross the border.SETHOh yeah. I, uh--SOOKI wish I could rid myself of thesefeelings of attraction for you. Ifear they will cause me to makecritical mistakes.Seth eyes POP. His watch BEEPS again, but this time he justtakes it off and shoves it in his pocket.INT. JSOC COMMAND HEADQUARTERS - DAYJSOC OPERATOR(to Agent Lacey)Double Axle’s non-responsive.Can’t reach him.AGENT LACEYFUCK!(then)Recall Carrier Strike Group DESRON-15. Recall QRF.

It’s so crazy!They return to passionate making out... until Sook suddenlydeflates, and starts to WEEP.THE INTERVIEW 84.3/15/12SOOKI’m a terrible person.SETHNo you’re not. Relationships arejust messy. Sometimes we have toexplore other-SOOKNo, I’m not bad for betraying him.I’m bad because I have helped him.He is a terrible man.SETHIt does seem like you could dobetter.SOOKWhen I met him I was just a girl.I was swept away by his power andhis kindness to me. But I see himin private. I hear what he says,and I see what he does. He has norespect for the North Koreanpeople. He is... wicked. And Ilie for him, I present him to theworld as something he is not.SETHSo quit! Leave him!SOOKIf I do, I could wind up in a laborcamp for the rest of my life.SETHLook... the whole reason I’m herein this completely fucked upcountry, risking my life, and notin a hot tub in the Hollywoodhills... is because I got to apoint in my life where if I didn’tstart doing something decent withit, there wasn’t a point in livingit anymore. Do you know what Imean?Sook looks at Seth. She grabs him and kiss him passionately.THE INTERVIEW 85.3/15/12INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHTKim, Dave, and just a few of Kim’s TOP GENERALS dine at asmall table. Kim is DRINKING HEAVILY. Dave, seated next toKim, gets MURDEROUS STARES from the other men.DAVE(sotto to Kim)I’m just doublechecking: are yousure it makes sense for me to behere at the table? Maybe it’s notthe most approp--KIMI am in great pain, Dave. Yourpresence is of comfort to me.DAVEThat’s so flattering. But I thinkmaybe the other guys don’t feel--Kim begins to WEEP.KIM(to everyone)I loved them like sons! To watchthem die so painfully, soneedlessly...(SOBBING)My heart will never heal!As Kim WEEPS, everyone else STARES DAGGERS at Dave.DAVE(to all)Again, I’d like to say that I’mjust incredibly sorry about therole I might have played in the...the injuries that transpired. Itwas very much an accident - Itripped. I mean if you don’tbelieve me, just look at the scrapeon my knee. It actually hurtsquite a bit, and--A SERVANT subtly taps Dave, a suggestion to drop it.KIMThey possessed the finest trait mencan have: loyalty. Withoutloyalty, a great man achievesnothing. Without loyalty, acountry is just a lawless jungle.THE INTERVIEW 86.3/15/12The generals all TOAST. Kim grows dark and angry.KIM (CONT'D)It is a cosmic farce, that two suchnoble men must die, when so manytraitors live. The defectors, theSouth Korean capitalists, thepeople in this country who doubt mybenevolence! These people - ifhorrible fates befall them, it isno tragedy,(pounding his fist)because they deserve no humanity!!Dave begins to look freaked.KIM (CONT’D)Those treasonous jackals inYonghung! I regret only that Ishowed them too much mercy!Dave has a flash of recognition at this word, “Yonghung.”KIM (CONT'D)Damn the weakness of my courage!To those who seek to undermine me,at home and abroad, I must neverrespond with less than the totalityof my strength and power!GENERAL JONGMr. President, I remind you theAmerican is in our presence.Kim nods, and collects himself.KIMMr. Skylark, I apologize for myindecorousness. I hope youunderstand what a difficult day ithas been.DAVEOf course, Mr. President.(getting up)Would you excuse me for nature’ssake?INT. BATHROOM, PRIVATE RESIDENCE - NIGHTKim’s private bathroom. Dave sits on the toilet and collectshimself. He notices a TOUCH SCREEN MONITOR on the wall.THE INTERVIEW 87.3/15/12It’s an internet browser, though currently set to the Koreanalphabet. He taps a GOOGLE icon in the corner. MostlyKorean characters, but there is one hyperlink for “English.”Dave navigates to WIKIPEDIA. Then to YONGHUNG. The entryreads: “Former Village in North Korea. In 1983, its entirepopulation was exterminated by a sarin gas attack on theorders of President Kim Il-Hwan, in response to a publicdemonstration of anger over the price of rice.”DAVE(spiraling into despair)I’m such an idiot...INT. DAVE’S GUEST ROOM - NIGHTDave sits in a chair, clutching the PISTOL, and lookingfreaked. He hears A DOOR SLAM - Seth must finally be back.INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATERDave tries Seth’s door - it’s locked. He knocks softly. Nono answer. He knocks again. No answer.

Istill love you, we’ll be fine,let’s pick it up in the morning.Dave pushes past him into the room, Seth looks bummed.DAVEI want to kill him. With the gun.SETHDude! Don’t say that!DAVEIt’s okay. I’m so fucking on boardfor this now. I’m gonna take thegun, put it straight up to his headand blow his goddamned brain--SETHShut up!Sook STEPS OUT of the closet.DAVEOh my god! Oh my god!Dave POINTS THE GUN AT SOOK.SETHDave, easy. Don’t do anythingrash.DAVEWhat the hell is the difference?We’re dead! She heard everything!How the hell did she get in here?!SOOKPut the gun down Mr. Skylark.DAVEOh, I so velly solly, but that anota-too a-rikeree.Seth SMACKS Dave in the face, causing him to drop the gun.DAVE (CONT’D)Ow! What the fuck?!THE INTERVIEW 89.3/15/12SETHWhat are you, two years old?! Wewere about to have sex.DAVEYeah, right.SETHIf it wasn’t true, would I havesaid it right in front of her?SOOKHe’s correct, Mr. Skylark.DAVE(to Seth)Seriously? Are you suicidal?She’s Kim’s mistress. And he’s gota real thing about loyalty.SOOK(to Seth, indignant)You were planning to kill thepresident?SETHI was going to tell you that, Iswear to god.DAVEYou were? And you accuse me ofthinking with my dick! I mean doyou have any idea how--SOOKYou can’t kill him!SETHOh, because he’s your boyfriend?SOOKBecause Koreans are tired of othernations controlling our destiny!SETHBut your people are starving.SOOKAnd they blame you. The UnitedStates.SETHRight. It’s a nation full ofbrainwashed sheep.THE INTERVIEW 90.3/15/12SOOKWe don’t have a free press.Citizens have one televisionchannel, one source for allinformation and education: thegovernment propaganda network.(pained)Me.DAVEUch. That is so dickish. Peoplehave the right to a free press!SOOKLike in America.DAVEExactly! Like in America.SOOKAnd do Americans watch the news?What receives the highest ratingduring your news hour?DAVE(proudly)We do. “Skylark Tonight.”SOOKI see.SETHDave, you get why that’s actually adig on us, right?Dave thinks for a moment, gets it, then sags.DAVEI give up. The world is a hopelessshit hole. I’m trying to dosomething good, but it’simpossible! Everything you do hassome stupid other consequence!Dave collapses on the bed and buries his face in a pillow.SETHWhat changed your mind about Kim?DAVEHe was talking about Yonghung, andI remembered you said he didsomething bad there. So I lookedit up on Wikipedia.THE INTERVIEW 91.3/15/12SOOKForgive me, but Younghung is a wellknownevent. Have you not read anyhistory of North Korea beforetoday?A beat.DAVEI wanted to, but I’ve been crazybusy.SOOKBut you... but this entire...DAVELook, I just don’t like reading.It makes me sleepy. I tried tofind documentaries on North Korea,but they all sucked. You guysdon’t let people with cameras inhere. I mean, you have to realize--SETH--that we live in a visual culture.DAVEWell, we do.Something is dawning on Seth.SETHHold on. Tomorrow night... When weinterview the president, what if weactually interview him?Sook smiles, but lets Seth lead the way.DAVEHow do you mean?SETHI mean we make it a real interview.We ask him about what he’s done asthe leader of this country.DAVEHe won’t allow it - he’ll shut itright down.THE INTERVIEW 92.3/15/12SOOKNo. I’m in charge of the signal.If he wants to end the interviewbefore I cut the feed, he will haveto get up and walk away from you.He must retreat from the prettyboyAmerican. Like a little pussy.Seth and Dave look to each other - damn, she’s a badass...INT. SALOON, RURAL KANSAS - DAYOn the big TV is BRIAN WILLIAMS.BRIAN WILLIAMSTonight, Kim Il-Hwan gives hisexclusive interview to DaveSkylark.

I feel good.I’m gonna get this sonofabitch.SETHHell yeah, you are.DAVEYou think we’ll die?SETHIf we do, we will have had morefun, and done more good than mostpeople do in a lifetime.DAVEI’m glad you were dumb enough tohitch your wagon to my star.SETHMe too.KNOCK KNOCK.PRODUCER (O.S.)Mr. Skylark, five minute warning.DAVEI just have one question.SETHAnything, buddy.DAVEYou and Sook were gone for 45minutes last night.

Sethand Sook look to each other - what the fuck do they do now?INT. HALLWAY - SAMETwo GUARDS enabled by GAS MASKS are RAMMING at the door.INT. INTERVIEW SET - SAMEDAVEMr. President, what we “agreed” isthat I would ask you a list ofquestions that you wrote yourself.KIMBe that as it may, that plan hasevidently been abandoned. But I amnot afraid of the truth. So goahead. Ask me anything.INT. COMPOUND CONTROL ROOM - SAMEThe guards keep ramming. Seth gets an idea: right after a“ram”, he gingerly unbolts the door. The guards who havealready set in motion their next ram come TUMBLING INTO THEROOM AND FALL FLAT ON THEIR FACES. Before they can get up,Sook GRABS A LARGE, HEAVY KIM PORTRAIT FROM THE WALL andSMASHES IT OVER A GUARD’S HEAD. Seth pounces and GRABS a GUNfrom one of them. He and Sook are now both armed.DAVEVery well, Mr. President. My nextquestion to pertains to remarks yourecently made in private.KIMIn... private?SOOKRoll tape!CONTROLLERTape? No one said anything aboutvideotape.SETH(aiming the gun)Press. Play.THE INTERVIEW 104.3/15/12The controller reluctantly hits play:VIDEO: It’s grainy footage from the personal presidentialarchive of KIM IN A MEETING WITH HIS AIDES.KIMDo not speak to me of hunger in thevillages! These people meannothing! They are not human! Iwill not weaken our nationaldefense to save a few hundredthousand decrepit old chickenfarmers, when they no longer evenhave chickens! Let them die!Prune the weak branches!INT. NORTH KOREAN PEASANT HOME - SAMEThe peasants are in COMPLETE SHOCK. This can’t be happening.BACK TO STUDIOKim is now perspiring and trembling.KIMSomeone within my government hasbetrayed me. No doubt the resultof coercion by someone in yours.Kim looks up to the control room for guidance from Sook.Sook quickly LOWERS HER WEAPON, gives another smile andthumbs up, and gestures to “Keep going!”One of the prone guards takes the opportunity with Sook’slowered weapon to KICK IT OUT OF HER HANDS. A massivestruggle between Seth, Sook and the guards. BANG! A gunaccidentally DISCHARGES. Bullets RICOCHET off the wallgetting one guard in the KNEE. BLOOD SPATTERS onto thecontrol room window (visible from the stage). Dave sees theblood spatter but does his best to ignore it.DAVEMr. President, in January, theUnited Nations shipped your countrya billion dollars in emergency foodrations. A British intelligencereport shows that the rations weresold and the proceeds diverted toNorth Korea's nuclear weaponsprogram. Are nuclear weapons ahigher priority for you than yourpeople’s nourishment?THE INTERVIEW 105.3/15/12KIMYou are exploiting my people’signorance for your own glory!DAVEYour people’s “ignorance”?KIMI... You... The North Korean peopledo not understand how governmentswork! They are not ready tocomprehend the complexities ofmaintaining a strong state!DAVEYou’re saying the North Koreanpeople are like children?INT. ANOTHER NORTH KOREAN PEASANT HOME - SAMEMORE PEASANTS are outraged, and begin SHOUTING at the TV.BACK TO STUDIO.KIMThis interview is over! You arecommitting an act of war on mycountry!BOOM! Someone is now RAMMING AT THE STUDIO DOORS.INT. COMPOUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUSSETHI think we should eject now.SOOK(determined)Not yet.(to controller)Cue image.CONTROLLERNo!SETHSook, are you crazy? We’re-Sook GRABS the controller and THROWS him across the room.She punches the CUE button.ON SCREEN:THE INTERVIEW 106.3/15/12A PHOTO OF KIM, standing in front of dozens of SLAINCIVILIANS, beaming.DAVEMr. President, is this you standingbefore the slaughtered civilians ofYonghung?BOOM! Another RAM ON THE STUDIO DOOR. Kim is too distraughtby Dave’s betrayal to notice. TEARS well in his eyes.KIMI thought you were my friend.DAVEI’m a journalist, Mr. President.BOOM! They’re one ram away from opening the door!DAVE (CONT'D)The two slain civilians in thelower right corner are clearlyyounger than 10 years old. Whatcrimes did they commit thatcondemned them to execution? Whyare you smiling in this photograph?KIMEnough!Kim WHIPS OUT A GUN from his leg holster, but just before hecan shoot Dave--Seth hits the button on his mission watch, and BEEEEEEEP!SSBM’s activate.Kim drops in agony. ALL PERSONNEL STILL STANDING THROUGHOUTTHE COMPOUND CRUMPLE.Dave dons his mask and hearing protection, and BOLTS, leapingover armed guards.Sook and Seth don their GAS MASKS (Sook stashed hers ahead oftime) and hearing protection and run.Everywhere is GUNFIRE, BLARING ALARMS AND CHAOS.EXT. NORTH KOREAN PEASANT VILLAGE - DAYVillagers STREAM OUT OF THEIR HOUSES INTO THE STREETS todiscuss with each other what they just witnessed.THE INTERVIEW 107.3/15/12INT. HALLWAY - DAYSpotting each other as the only masked ones in a haze of teargas, Seth, Dave and Sook, rendezvous. Sook leads thembounding over the strewn, suffering compound personnel.EXT. COMPOUND - DAYSook, Seth and Dave make it outside and whip off their masks.They start to charge for the mountains when--SETH(points)Shit!A MASSIVE CONVOY OF NORTH KOREAN MILITARY VEHICLES headingtheir way. There must be thousands of men.SETH (CONT’D)We’re too late! We’ll never blowpast that!DAVEI know what we can do.EXT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATERThey stand before the TANK.SETHAre you serious?DAVEI know how to drive it.INT. TANK FIGHTING COMPARMENT - MOMENTS LATERSook, Dave and Seth are squeezed in. Dave POWERS UP thetank. John Mellencamp’s “AUTHORITY SONG” starts blasting.SETHWhat the hell is with that?EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUSThe tank ROARS OUT OF THE HANGAR, and across the property.Kim’s forces are taken by surprise. They run for cover asthe tank BARRELS ACROSS THE PROPERTY.THE INTERVIEW 108.3/15/12SETH (O.C.)Dude! Can we kill the Mellencamp?DAVE (O.C.)I gotta focus on the road! Youdeal!SETH (O.S.)Is it this red button?!DAVE (O.S.)NO! That’s the--BOOM! The tank FIRES A ROUND AS IT CRASHES THROUGH THEPERIMETER WALLS and roars down the road.INT. MOUNTAIN FOREST - LATERSeth, Sook and Dave, are deep in the wilderness, seeminglysafe for the moment. The tank is ditched.SETH(checks his mission watch)Still no response. I don’t knowhow far the extraction team is.Dave CRINGES.SETH (CONT’D)What’s up?DAVEUh, listen. Don’t get mad oranything, but I might’ve made alittle goof.Seth and Sook look at Dave with dread.DAVE (CONT’D)After the incident with the guards,I got all tweaked and... I toldJSOC we were aborting the mission.SOOKYou can’t be serious.SETHOh my god.DAVE (CONT’D)I was just trying to be considerateand not waste their time!(then)Anyway, they were upset.THE INTERVIEW 109.3/15/12SETH“Upset”? We wasted a month oftheir lives and a billion dollars.Why would you inform them of thatbefore they sent our rescue team?DAVEMy head was all foofy. I’d beenthrough a very emotionallywrenching experience.SOOKSo there’s no rescue team to get usout of the country?SETHYou stupid, fuck-brained, asswipe--DAVEHey! Did I not just kick seriousass in there? I’ve gone through ashitload of personal growth in thepast two days. So I think I can beforgiven for forgetting some stuff.Now let’s just--The sounds of MULTIPLE ENEMY HELICOPTERSDAVE (CONT’D)(shouts over the noise)-- SO LET’S JUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNTTHE TOTALITY OF MY CONTRIBUTIONS,AND NOT GIVE INTO KNEE-JERK ANGERABOUT MY...INT. COMPOUND HOLDING CELL - NIGHTSook, Dave and Seth are detained in a grim cell with a windowoverlooking the compound. Seth hands Sook a SUICIDE PILL.SETHAnd here’s one for you.SOOKThank you.SETHIf Kim had died by poison as in theoriginal plan, it would haveprevented us from having to.THE INTERVIEW 110.3/15/12DAVEThanks for pointing that out. I’llknow for next time.SOOKNo, Seth. You’re thinking ofyourself, and not of history.Maybe our lives are at an end, butat least history won’t be stained.What you did was brave. You’reheroes.Seth and Dave look to each other, remembering - this is whatthey’d wanted.SETH(to Sook)You’re a hero, too.SOOKI’m glad I met you both. You mademy life meaningful.(then)If perhaps shorter than expected.Kim approaches, flanked by guards. Kim stares at Dave for along time, as if trying to make sense of this man. As ifalmost still hoping that their friendship was real. Finally:KIMWell, Mr. Skylark, if you actuallythought this plan would succeed,you’re even more obtuse andvainglorious than I had imagined.Dave looks to Seth, quizzically.SETHThey’re insults.KIMThe saddest part of your impendingdeath is that I will miss “SkylarkTonight.” Your show was a joyfuldiversion. As the world becomesmore serious, there’s an importantplace in our lives for the trivial.DAVE(actually considering)I’d never thought of it that way.THE INTERVIEW 111.3/15/12SOOKI’m glad that I will at least die ahappy woman. Now that I have beenfucked properly.A gut punch to Kim.SOOK (CONT’D)(re: Seth)He was so powerful. I’ve neverfelt such intense pleasure. Iwonder if your wife - or any woman -will still find you attractive.Seeing as these two simpletonAmericans just turned you into ajoke on world-wide television.SETHShe was particularly responsive tobeing taken from behind. I guessshe never did that with you due toyour lack of height and shortpenis. Anyway, it was quite aspectacle. I’m surprised herscreaming didn’t wake you up.Kim grabs his GUN from his calf holster. As he starts to aimit at them, BANG!But the gunfire came from Kim’s snipers - it’s being directedat the compound perimeter! BANG! BANG!Everyone looks out the window. NORTH KOREAN CITIZENS arestorming the compound.DAVEWhat the hell’s going on?SOOKJust what it looks like. It’s arevolt.KIM GUARD #1(into his radio)Plan R! Plan R!Kim Guard #2 opens a BLACK BRIEF CASE. Inside are twoCOMPACT MACHINE GUNS. Kim takes them both, and sprintsacross the field, frequently turning to SPRAY SUPPRESSINGFIRE with both hands. But if that isn’t bad-ass enough--A FAST-MOVING ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE catches up with Kim. Kimleaps into the passenger seat without it even slowing down.THE INTERVIEW 112.3/15/12As it races toward the forest and BARRELS THROUGH ANIMALFENCING and mud, Kim manages to stand upright and maintainhis double-handed suppressing fire.At the edge of the FOREST, a fucking HELICOPTER RISES UP FROMbehind the trees and drops a rope ladder. Kim tosses thespent machine guns, LEAPS OFF THE MOVING ATV ONTO THEDANGLING LADDER, and climbs his way up into the helicopterwhich quickly retreats behind the treeline, and disappears.DAVEUm... Was that...SETHYes. It was categorically mostawesome thing we’ve ever seen.Dave sees from the opposite direction that the revolters areheading for them.DAVEHoly shit, they’re gonna kill us!SOOKNot if they know it’s us. Dave,make yourself visible.Dave puts his face up to the window and waves. He isRECOGNIZED by the revolters. They CHEER. They begin HACKINGAWAY AT THE WALLS with picks and axes. It won’t be long now.Seth takes Sook’s hand.SETHCome with us to the States.SOOKSeth...SETHCome on. We connected from thefirst day. You know it.SOOKYes. I feel it too, Seth. But mycountry appears to be on the brinkof a revolution.DAVEHe makes an outstanding rack oflamb. Do you know how hard it isto find a guy who can cook?THE INTERVIEW 113.3/15/12SOOKI’ll never forget you.Sook kisses Seth, passionately.CRASH! The walls are reduced to rubble! The revolters stormin, and RAISE DAVE up ON THEIR SHOULDERS in celebration!DAVE(pointing to Seth)Him too! Him too!The revolters raise Seth up on their shoulders too!Seth, from his high vantage point, sees Sook slip off withSEVERAL MEN she seems to know. It’s good-bye...INT. PLANE - NIGHTThe flight back to the States. Seth looks emotionallywrecked. He hasn’t touched his champagne, so finally Davehelps himself to it.DAVECome on, man. There’s a lot tocelebrate.Seth is non-responsive.DAVE (CONT’D)I know you liked her, but do youeven realize the avalanche of pussyabout to hit us? I’m actuallyfrightened.SETHShe honeypotted me.DAVESook? No way.SETHShe researched our psych profiles.She knew us better than we knewourselves. She didn’t love me, sheused me.DAVENo. I just don’t believe that.SETHSook’s a professional propagandist.A master manipulator.THE INTERVIEW 114.3/15/12(MORE)She convinced Kim to do theinterview, she seduced me andinfiltrated our conspiracy, andcommandeered it to make it herplan. This was never ouradventure. It was hers.Dave considers this. It seems crazy, but... possible?DAVEMan... if that’s true, it kind ofmakes her even hotter.Seth crumples.EXT. WHITE HOUSE FRONT STEPS - DAYThe PRESIDENT hangs MEDALS OF HONOR on Seth and Dave.INT. DAILY SHOW SET - NIGHTDave and Seth walk on stage. Stewart does the “I’m notworthy bow.”INT. DAVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHTDave and Agent Lacey lie breathless, post-coital. Sheremoves her GLASSES, having worn them for Dave’s excitement.INT. SETH’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTSeth sits alone in the dark staring at nothing, in utterdepression. ELAPSED time shows little movement from him asthe sun rises on him.TITLE UP: 3 MONTHS LATERINT. SKYLARK TONIGHT CONTROL ROOM - NIGHTCONTROLLERAnd five, four, three, two...DAVEGood evening, America. Ourscheduled guest tonight was NobelPeace laureate Ellen JohnsonSirleaf, but Ms. Sirleaf has kindlyaccommodated a last minute change.THE INTERVIEW 115.3/15/12SETH (CONT'D)SETHWhat the hell is he talking about?DAVEIt is my great honor and privilegeto introduce the new president ofthe Democratic People’s Republic ofNorth Korea, Sook Yong-Rim.Sook enters and sits with Dave.Seth is in SHOCK. He looks to the control room guys - whatthe fuck? They give apologetic shrugs.SOOKHi, Dave. It’s wonderful to seeyou again.DAVEMadam President, there’s so much tocover. The miraculous turnaroundin your economy, the dismantling ofyour nuclear weapons program...SETHHe just had to have this particularguest? He couldn’t just let thisone go, and spare me the torture?Seth storms out.INT. SETH’S OFFICE - LATERSeth is slumped on his office couch, watching the interviewalone in the dark.SOOK... And while we have released allpolitical prisoners, we need moreresources to help them reintegratewith North Korean society.Seth swallows the dregs from his GLASS OF WHISKEY. He checkshis watch: the hour’s almost up. He aims the remote to turnoff the TV--DAVEMadam President, before we go, I dohave one question of a morepersonal nature. Is there a firstman of North Korea?THE INTERVIEW 116.3/15/12SOOKNo, Dave. Not at this time.Dave lets the silence hang for a moment. He puts on his“emotional face”, and lets his opponent’s wall weaken.DAVEI’m sure many in the world findthat surprising about you. Yourbeauty, your intelligence, yourloving heart.Sook takes a moment to fight back emotion.SOOKShortly before the revolution,there was someone. We fell in lovevery quickly, but...(choking up)... but the relationship was notpractical. Or at least, that wasmy belief at the time. It was achaotic moment and I made the bestdecision I could. But it is one ofthe great regrets of my life.Seth is surprised - really?DAVEMadam President, would you talk tohim right now, if you could?SETHNo. What the fuck is he doing--Several STAFFERS ENTER and start to DRAG SETH to set.SETH (CONT’D)(struggling to freehimself)No. I’m not doing this on camera!DAVEMadam President, that man happensto be here tonight. And I’m surehe’d like to speak with you.Staffers DRAG SETH ONTO THE SKYLARK TONIGHT SET.SOOKHello, Seth.THE INTERVIEW 117.3/15/12SETH(nervous)Hi.SOOKIt’s so good to see you.SETHYou too.SOOKI’ve missed you.SETHReally?SOOK(beginning to weep)No. I’m just humiliating myself oninternational television for thethrill of it.Like every guest who’s come before, Seth starts to CRY.SETHWell you could’ve called! Do youknow what I’ve been through? Doyou realize what kind of impossiblebar you’ve set for women in mylife?SOOKIf I had called, what could I havesaid? You know I can’t leave NorthKorea. And I could hardly ask youto leave America.SETHWhy not? Sook, the one time I’veever felt good about myself waswith you! And how much more ofAmerica do I need to see? I meanwe’re talking about a country whereDave Skylark is now taken seriouslyas a political pundit!Sook LAUGHS through her tears.SETH (CONT'D)For god’s sake, get me out of thishell hole and take me home withyou!Now DAVE STARTS TO CRY. Classic “Skylark Tonight.”THE INTERVIEW 118.3/15/12INT. SETH’S OFFICE - LATERDAVEHow am I gonna survive without you?SETHThere’s 1,000 guys who can do myjob. Most with a better attitude.DAVEI mean the rest of life. Who am Igonna party with? I’m gonna missyou so much, I can’t even take it.SETHI’m gonna miss you too, man.DAVECan I just tell you how awesomeyour new girlfriend is? You gottasee the present she brought me...EXT. SKYLARK STUDIOS - SUNSETIn the parking lot sits... KIM’S WORLD WAR II TANK.SETHIs that...?DAVEFuck yeah.EXT. 101 FREEWAY - SUNSETThe tank ROLLS UP THE FREEWAY, flanked by a MOTORCYCLE POLICEESCORT. It’s a rolling party. PARTIERS hang out on thedecks and turret. Mellencamp’s “Authority Song” blasts.Dave, Seth, Sook, and Agent Lacey protrude from the hatch,all holding bottles of champagne, having a ball.FADE OUT.THE END *THE INTERVIEW 119.3/15/12
